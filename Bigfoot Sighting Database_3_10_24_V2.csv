BFRO,Alaska,Anchorage,13038,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,2004,February,NA,Winter,A,animal,NA,"I and two of my friends were bored one night so we decided to do a little snowmachining. Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage, there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house. We took off at probably 11 pm, rode up the road about a quarter mile, and cut off on the trails. It had snowed about 10 inches a few days before so there was fresh snow, with no tracks. I was leading the way for about a half hour, then we stopped and talked for a little bit. We took off again and kept cruising on some sort of game trail that led to an opening in the woods. I rode off into the opening with my friends following about fifty yards behind me. I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down. I figured it was just a moose or something. But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot. It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me. It was running in the opposite direction. I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind. It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness. I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said ""We need to get out of here,"" and rode back towards my house. When I told them about it back near my house, they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods. But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else. The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn't anything human. For a long time I was made fun of and everyone told me I was crazy so I didn't like talking about it.","powerline clearings east of Potter Marsh , clear cuts for pipeline , Anchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge","Anchorage, Hillside",None,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,207,NA,NA,NA,NA,"woods , in a clearing with snow",small shrubs and bushes,NA,NA,NA,3.66,12.0,4,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,dark brown,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,fleeing,yes,NA,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Some tracks in the snow, and a clearing in the fresh snow where it looked like a large animal had pushed snow aside and layed down.",1,"running away with angled elbows, snow was a foot deep and it ran smoothly",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=13038
BFRO,Alaska,Anchorage,8792,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,2003,December,NA,Winter,B,action,NA,"Me and a couple of friends had been bored, when I decided we should take a walk through the woods behind my house. I didn't think much of it, as me and my friend have done it many times before. There were four of us, and we set out at about 11 o'clock at night. It was rather dark, but there was light from the moon. The weather was rather cold, as we did this in the winter. The area we walked on was game trails (trails that moose walk on) as well as trails used for mushers, runners, cross country skiiers, and that sort. We had walked about 2 miles from my house to another entrance where most people enter. On the way we had talked about unexplainable events or things such as bigfoot, and UFOs. When we reached the bridge where most people come in, one friend had smoked a cigarette. We then saw a light and decided to go on. On the way back, we heard wild dogs barking wildly, and decided to pick up the speed. It eventually became a sprint, whereafter we walked. When we walked, we continued talking about it. It was then I had realized, some thing had been following us, as well as testing us, or even harassing us. It was much earlier, I just didnt think about it. I had thought it was my friend Warren, who is sometimes clumsy. I had thought it was him who had made noises such as slipping, but it was really something throwing stuff at us. I had realized this about half way back. I asked if Warren kept slipping, when he told me it wasn't, and he thought I could have been pulling a prank. We stopped for a minute to listen when I told the others something strange was going on. We stopped, and shone a flashlight around, hearing noises such as steps, and branches moving and breaking. The leader had thought I had been playing a joke when I told him seriously, I wasn't. He decided to walk behind with me, when something threw snowballs, and nearly hit us on many occasions. It was then he realized that this was no joke, and we picked up a light jog, for most of the way. When we were almost out of the woods, we had again heard dogs, and maybe 20 ft away, the branches breaking, and again, something throwing stuff at us. By the time we left, it was about 3-3:30 in the morning. I did not go directly to my house because I didn't know if it was still following us. I know this was not a prank because the snow is more then 5 ft deep in the woods, and someone would have a extremely hard time to play a prank like that.","Dowling Road , left of Lake Otis",Anchorage,Dowling Road,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2300,NA,NA,NA,NA,"pine forest , bog , creek",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"throwing snowballs , branch breaking , stalking",NA,NA,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,"Chugach Mountains, moon 85% full",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=8792

I have never seen an animal like what we saw that day. we watched it for over a half hour move from one tree accross the clearing to the other tree. eventually, caribou moved into the area and we lost sight of the animal when it moved off into heavy brush.

BFRO,Alaska,Bristol Bay,11616,Stan Courtney,2004,July,20,Summer,B,footprint,NA,"To whom it may concern, I am a commercial fisherman in Alaska and have been doing so since 1970. I am an avid outdoorsman, hunter and someone who just loves to get out there. Every year after fishing, I try to take a trip up river with a friend or two to wind down and enjoy ourselves before we go home. This year while I was on this trip into Alaska's interior our main mission was to take pictures of bears and the surrounding wildlife to promote a new bear viewing and sports fishing buisness. While on our five day trip, we spotted more than fourty bears. I took hundrends of pictures of these bears and their tracks. One of which, was so big, it put chills up my spin and gave me and my companions a very uneasy sense of insecurity. What set this track apart from the others was it's enormous size and human shape. In one of the pictures that I took of this track, I placed my foot next to it on the ground, keep in mind I am wearing a size 13 boot. Whatever made this track was so heavy, heavier than the biggest bear, that it pushed the gravel so far into the earth that it made us truly speculate what we were looking at. Other pictures that we took of bear tracks were nowhere close to the indentation that this track had left. One of the most intriguing things about this track was there were no visible claw marks as with all the other bear tacks. Both of us felt extremely uneasy of our surroundings and had the feeling that we were being watched. For the rest of the day we didn't have much to talk about, and that night felt uncomfortable at camp. We never heard or smelt anything out of the ordinary. To this day I'm not too sure what we saw and I'm not making any claims other than the words I have put fourth. I would like to include the photos I spoke of, as maybe you or someone on your staff might help me shed some light on this situation. I want nothing but to put my mind at ease. Wether this is a bear track from an extrememly enormous bear or...?

We were trying to make it to the camp sites near the glachier but it started getting too dark even for us . So we decided to camp at the first available site . We found a small spot right off the trail so we made camp and hung our supplies in a tree down the trail , started a fire and were just finishing a small meal when I walked to the trail to smoke. I was standing on the trail a few minutes when I noticed what I thought was a man on a bike coming down the trail. I let my partner know, but when I looked back it was still in the same spot. I started looking more closely to see a face or the bike or something. It was then I realized it wasn't a person. It was a large dark form legs spread apart, this is what led me to think it was a person on a bike. The arms were curled at it's side like someone with hands on handle bars. Too big for a bear and the legs were too far apart. I called my partner but when turned back to look at it again it moved very quickly into the woods on two legs.

BFRO,Alaska,Fairbanks,1258,NA,1975-1979,NA,NA,Summer,A,animal,NA,"I was part of a group of about a dozen Army personnel training in the area. It was summer on a warm clear day. We were above treeline and had been camped there for several days. I was looking across the nearest valley when I spotted movement. It was on the base of a steep mountainside in bare, rocky terrain, with snowfields descending down the small gullies on the hillside. It was moving up the valley about a half mile away. When it crossed the snow, you could plainly see that it was not a bear. It walked upright with long strides and arms swinging and moved fast across the white snow. It was dark in color like a bear. I have seen bears many times since in the same type of terrain and they do not move like this did. It was too big and fast to be a human. Bears can and do walk upright, usually for short instances when they need to see or smell something and need the height. They don't travel in this manner and not in difficult terrain. I pointed it out to the other guys and we watched it until you could no longer see it. When it was out of the snow it was hard to see against the rocks. We wanted to go look at the tracks but everyone was scared to go down there. We had to sleep there that night and nobody would go outside after dark. The next day we got out and never went back. Twenty years later, I still would not go up there even with a group and with guns.

BFRO,Alaska,Fairbanks,1995,Kevin Withers,1997,August,15-31,Fall,B,vocalization,NA,"This happened in late August of 1997 in a side valley of Goldstream Valley, a relatively populated area just north of Fairbanks. Although it's quite close to the Fairbanks area and there are many houses and roads in the main part of Goldstream, the side valleys are still as wild as they were a thousand years ago. I was hunting ruffed grouse in one if these side valleys (I prefer not to say which one). I was on a south-facing aspen covered hillside, and had hunted all afternoon and evening, intending to spend the night out on the hill and hunt my way back in the morning. As I was making camp, a black bear almost walked right into me. I heard him coming from a ways off, and scared him away before he got closer. later on, it will become apparent why I mention this. So I was sleeping out in the open, no tent, under a spruce tree. Sometime in the middle of the night, I was awakened by something prowling around my camp, maybe thirty feet or so away from me, walking in a circle. I mentioned the bear before. . . this was not a bear I heard in the night. My father is a hunting guide, and I literally grew up hunting bears. I KNOW what a bear sounds like when it's walking. Whatever this thing was, it was walking on two legs, with a bit of a shuffling sound between each step, like it was dragging its feet a bit. The leaves on the forest floor were dry like potato chips, and it was breaking a lot of branches--I could hear it and follow its movement quite distinctly. I have to say here that I've spent a LOT of time in the Alaskan bush, and have never before or since been truly afraid of anything I've encountered, but I don't mind saying that on that particular night I was literally shaking with fear. It circled my camp for what seemed like hours, but it was probably only five minutes or so. Finally, remembering something I had once read about the Athabascan Indians' beliefs regarding ""woodsmen"", I started talking to it, albeit in a shaky voice, saying I wanted no trouble that night. The thing stopped dead in its tracks, then a few moments later, I heard it trotting downhill, away from me. Talking to such a creature may sound kinda cornball, but all I know is that it worked. I've kicked myself for this many times since, but the next morning, I didn't bother to look for any tracks, hair, etc. I just packed up and resumed my hunting. I had no further trouble with the woodsman. As a final couple of notes, I do recall hearing kind of low muttering sound as it was prowling around me. Also, having since done some reading on Bigfoot sightings, I've noticed that a lot of people report the animal having a strong foul odor to it. However, I did not smell any particular odor, foul or otherwise.","side valley of Goldstream Valley , north of O'Connor Creek",Fairbanks,Jones Road,Goldstream Valley,NA,NA,NA,NA,207,NA,clear,cresent,NA,south-facing hillside,"aspen trees , spruce trees , willow trees , birch trees",NA,NA,5,9.14,30.0,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"circling camp  , branch breaking",NA,"shuffling feet , dragging feet",bipedal,low muttering,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"The witness is a twenty-six year old archeologist who works for a consulting company.

BFRO,Alaska,Fairbanks,26604,Charles Lamica,2009,July,NA,Summer,A,animal,NA,"It was the month of July, 2009 in Fairbanks Alaska. I was heading south on Auburn Dr toward Farmers Loop which was about 1 mile away. It is a wooded area frequented by homes and in general would be considered a populated area. Houses are on an average of about 100 to 200 feet apart with only the general area around and close to the homes cleared out. Most of the area by far is wooded. It was the section of the road where it passes by Pearl Creek Elementary school. The school can be seen through the woods. Some of the woods in the area are quite thick and in some places can’t be seen into more than about 10 or 15 feet. But in this area, it had apparently been cleaned out quite a bit and sightlines into the section of the sighting were very open. The school and vegetable garden could be seen off to the right from the road I was on. It was about 6pm and I was heading home after a day of working on a deck I was building. The weather was clear with the sun high in the sky. As I was driving, I happened to notice a “man” standing by the right side of the road about 100 yards ahead. It was more of an unconscious recognition. There’s nothing unusual about a man standing on the side of the road in this area. As I got to within about 50 yards, I looked closer. “That’s no man” I said to myself (I was alone in the car). Shortly after that, 1 or 2 seconds, he bolted into the woods towards the school. He did it like a wild animal would do if spooked. I didn’t slow down until I got to the place where I saw him go into the woods which is where I stopped. I could see him running away from the road and when he was into the woods about 30 yards or so, he turned left and was now running parallel to the road in the same direction I was heading. I got a good look at him, but not his face. I could have probably seen his face had I not been so mesmerized and had the presence of mind to look at it. I was busy noticing other things. His fur or hair looked to be about 3 to 4 inches all over the main part of his body. It was a reddish rusty color. I was mildly struck by how red it was, but it definitely had some rustyness to it. He was about 6 feet tall and looked to weigh about 200 lbs. He ran with a strange “Hoppy” kind of run. It wasn’t a limp. With one foot he pushed off with was more a normal running move, but the other foot he pushed off with propelled him upward (about a foot or less) and forward. I watched him until he disappeared into the woods. There was a road about 100 yards ahead and I took off to get to it so I could turn right and in 20 yards turn right again to the road that lead to the school parking lot. So the wooded area he was in was sort of a peninsula and he seemingly had to be in there somewhere. The woods I was looking into from that angle were quite thick and I didn’t see him and haven’t seen him since. A little farther up on the right was the school garden that had people in it (around 7 - 10) which I’m now sorry I didn’t stop to go talk to them about it. The next day as I was driving in to work on the deck, I naturally slowed down in the area I saw him (stopped actually) and was surveying the area when a couple walking their dogs were approaching. I flagged them down and told the story of what happened the evening before and they told me that about a week before they were with their dogs and were on the way other side of the school property by the soccer field and 3 kids came running over to them saying “Did you see the sasquatch, did you see the sasquatch.” They also said that what appeared to be a Dad was with them who didn’t seem to excited about it. My conclusion to whether it was real or not is summed up by saying. “It was either real or there was a man in a VERY, VERY convincing costume.” I reported it to the fish and game office in Fairbanks a couple days later. The person who was taking the report was sort of rolling his eyes through the whole thing as he seemed to be writing it down on a piece of scrap paper-.

The creature was about 100 yards away when first seen, but as the sighting progressed the distance was reduced to about 20 to 30 yards. 2. The witness didn't get a good look at the creature's face or its feet. He described the shape of the head as being a cross between that of a human and a gorilla. The hair on the body seemed to be fairly uniform in length, about three to four inches, and was not matted or scruffy looking. 3. He has no explanation for the unusual gait of the creature, and could not speculate as to the possibility of an injury or deformity that might cause it. 4. The witness says he is inclined to believe what he saw was a real non-human animal, but it was definitely not a bear. He recognizes that there is a remote chance that someone could have been carrying out a hoax, but he indicated that if it was someone in a costume it was so convincing that it would have to be a costume of Hollywood-professional quality.",yes,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=26604

I've lived here almost all my life and there is no animal like this one..I thought to myself the only way that could have been an orangutan is if there's a circus out here.. I knew that was not a possibility in such a remote area. I drove right next to it and I was at it's level. If I had been going slow, I could have touched it easily.

We were traveling west about 14 miles on the US side of the US Canada border on the Alcan highway. My son was driving. If you've ever driven that road, then you know how the pavement has huge dips in it, I suspect from the freezing and thawing of the foundation of soil under the pavement.

I am 64 years old and have 40+ years in law enforcement, currently serving as chief of police. With hunting season not to open until the day after next, we were in no hurry and enjoyed the evening with a touch of good single malt Irish talking about our past hunts and the one we were about to have. Loyd and Davis would not arrive until the first day of the hunt, presumably because Dave had become domesticate sometime after the previous year’s hunt and had to attend a retirement party before being allowed to leave Valdez for camp. With the evening expended and the toll the day had taken on us we were in our sleeping bags and doubtlessly turning logs into sawdust by 2300 hours. The stove was stoked with fresh firewood and all was good. About 0215 I awoke feeling way too warm, unzipped my bag, slinging the top off, when I heard a resounding crack of wood striking wood, similar to a Louisville Slugger solidly striking a large, sound Birch tree very close to the cabin. There being no one within many miles of us, my attention was immediately focused on the sound. A few seconds later, the sound was repeated, which was to be the pattern for several minutes while I attempted to evaluate it to determine its source. I finally decided to wake Bill saying in just above a whisper, “hey Bill”. He stirred responding with something that sounded like “what” and did not move again for twenty minutes; when he woke up and asked what was going on. In the mean time the commotion stopped when I initially attempted to awaken Bill up and I was sitting on the bunk with my .450 in hand waiting for whatever eventuality might arise. Nearing 0300 hours I finally returned to a sound slumber awaking well into the following morning. With a spot of coffee in our gullets and having explained to Bill the events of the previous night we explored the area of the old village, inclusive of the nearby grave yard, in an effort to find an explanation. We found numerous paths traversing the grassy area around the cabins with a multitude of bedding sites. Never did we find anything that would provide us with an answer to the question of the source of sounds. Explaining this to another friend after our return, with the experience of spending many years living in numerous villages, he asked me if there was a native graveyard nearby. It is less than 50 yards from the cabin.

The area, according to Ed, was known for its concentration of berries and black bears. The salmon run was in the early starting stage. Solid forest was estimated to be about 100 miles away. Ed did not have even a shadow of a doubt about the identity of the animal he had seen, particularly since he had previously hunted many of the large game animals of Alaska. Hair of the described appearance can be estimated to be 18-24"" long. The interest of this sighting with its rather meager contents lies in its geographical latitude. The center of Prince William Sound lies at 60 degree, 40 minutes N. Additional Alaskan sighting reports are to be found in Green (1978), and in an article in the magazine ""Alaska"" of October, 1995, pp. 25-27. Aside from reports in the Alaska Panhandle, e.g., near Hyder, Ward Cove on Prince of Wales Island, and in the Wrangell Narrows (by Bob Titmus himself), all in the vicinity of 56 degrees N., there are scattered sightings farther north. On the Alaska Peninsula, a cluster of sightings have been recorded near Chignik Lake (55 degree, 54 minutes N), Manokotak near Kulukak Bay (58:40 N), Togiak drainage (59 N), Lake Iliamna (59:30 N), and yet farther north near Galena, 120 miles inland from Norton Sound (64:44 N) and Kotzebue Sound at the Arctic Circle (66:33). All of these sites are on the coast or within ready sasquatch walking distance of it and are, consequently, moderated by the ocean. Such cannot be said for inland sightings, such as that near Fort Yukon, south of the Brooks Range, or Dawson Creek (NE British Columbia; detailed in Hunter and Dahinden, 1993). Both of these locations are exposed to the full brunt of the arctic winter. Seasonal migration would appear to be of immediate advantage in these regions as compared to the overall temperate Pacific Northwest, though unlikely to be established in view of the rarity of these events.

Instead of being rewarded with owls responding to my calls I heard a scream or moan about three quarters of a mile away like I had never heard before. I asked my friend what in the hell was that? He replied that it was probably what some of the old farmhands referred to over the years as the hairy man, which some of them had told of seeing from time to time for many years. I hooted once again and the same scream replied only closer this time. We stood there a little longer and could hear something big coming up the hill through the woods very quickly. By the time we got into the truck we were treated to another hair curling scream still in the woods but getting close to the hayfield. We cranked the truck and drove as fast as we could thru the bumpy field. When we arrived at the gate my friend asked me to get out and close the gate so that nobody could trespass onto the property. The gate was a quarter to a half a mile away from where we were run out of the field. As I opened the truck door to get out I was treated to yet another scream from the hay field. The gate did not get closed that night. What this was I do not know. I know that there was no livestock kept in this part of the farm. I do know that if this thing were discovered and somehow befriended that it would be a great asset to the U.S. Olympic team, for neither Jesse Owens or Carl Lewis can run cross country like this thing.

We lived in a trailer on hurricane rd. and my grand parents owned the hurricane landing & fish camp ( what is now perkins landing ). We were left without power after the hurricane so all our food was on ice. It was about 11:00 pm and my dad asked me to walk to my grandparents store and get some ice, so I grabbed a flashlight and took off walking, it was less than a quarter of a mile from our house to the store and I was very used to walking the route on a daily bases. So I'm walking down the left side of the road and I can here the dogs barking and really cuttin up, they belonged to an older man who lived in a little white house down the road on the right. He kept them in a pin behind his house so when I get in front of the house I shine my light across the street at and around the house, suddenly I see something very large run from behind the house on two legs. I followed it with my light as it ran toward the woods, and then it stopped and turned and looked at me. It's eyes glowed red in the dark, and all the sudden it runs straight at me, it was so fast, I mean it traveled about 30 or 40 yards in just a flash and then it stopped right at the edge of the road. I was scared frozen, I couldn't scream or run and we just stood there for what seemed like an eternity but in all actuality was probably just a second or two. Then suddenly it let out a load high pitched growling sound and then I screamed and it turned and ran and I ran all the way home. When I got home I was so upset I could hardly breath or talk, my parents finally calmed me down and I told them what happened but they didn't believe me. The next day my dad and my uncle went down there to look for tracks but they didn't find any. My uncle told me I probably saw a bear but even I know a bear can't run on two legs. The creature I saw was extremely large, I would have to say now that it was at least 7 feet tall very broad shoulders, covered from head to toe in dark brown to black hair, his mouth and large, square teeth kind of stuck out from the rest of the face and the eyes were sunk in.

He needed to go into work that Sunday morning briefly. The sighting happened as he was returning home. He was approximately 100 yards away when he first saw it. He was coming around the bend in the express way when it came into view. There were no other cars in front or behind him. He surmised it waited until there were no vehicles visible in either direction before it crossed the highway, but then he caught it by surprise when he rounded the curve. The figure was already on Rick's side of the express way, roughly in the middle of the road, when it came into view. He cannot say for sure that it was covered with fur, but it was all the same dark color, with no indication of clothes or shoes, etc. He strongly thinks it was not a human for various reasons, including the fact that a person would likely not be running across the express way in that area, and then continue running into the trees where there are no obvious trails, and be completely out of view within a few seconds. Rick has seen deer crossing the express way in recent weeks also. Cotton Creek passes underneath the express way just before the crossing point, so the figure was generally paralleling the path of the creek when it crossed. In Google Maps satellite images of the area you can see a large structure a few hundred yards further up the highway from the crossing spot. That is a brand new structure for ""Toy Box Storage"".

BFRO,Alabama,Barber,27067,Mary Ross,1980,January,12,Winter,A,animal,NA,"I have been reluctant to share my story because of my field of work, and do not want to have people think I am “crazy” as this could damage my career. But, as I get older, I feel this incident needs to be documented.The incident occurred in the winter of 1980 a few miles east of Clayton, Alabama in Barbour County. I was traveling with my Aunt, Grandmother and four younger cousins to a relative’s house. It was dark and probably around 9pm from the best I can remember. For some reason, my Aunt needed to turn around and proceeded to pull off the roadway by a small clearing. I was in the front seat of the car with my Aunt, who was driving, and my Grandmother. As we turned off the road, the headlights caught a figure in mid-stride. It then immediately froze and did not move anymore. It was about 30 yards from the car – very close. I could see the entire side view of this creature and its body was slightly turned so that it was looking at us. The most terrifying thing in my memory is this things huge eyes glaring at us. The best way I can describe the creature’s expression is “stunned.” The face was covered in hair except for around the eyes. The hair was dark and appeared longer and wavy looking on the arms and legs. It was very tall and massive yet lean looking. I would say it was easily over 7 feet tall, if not more. When it “froze” in the headlights, one arm was slightly extended behind the creature and it held this position. At this point, my Grandmother was crying and begging my Aunt to drive away. Two of my younger cousins were huddled on the floorboard in the backseat crying. I was terrified but could not look away. My Aunt kept telling my Grandmother “there is no way he can get in this car” and she kept the car still and we watched this motionless creature for about two to three minutes. It was almost completely motionless. It was as if the creature thought we could not see him if he did not move. I don’t know how it stood so still. The hair on my neck is standing on end as I type this. It scared me terribly. He kept staring at us with his eyes stretched very wide. I’ll never forget that “look” he gave us. Finally, my Aunt decided to flash the lights on and off real quick. The instant she did this, the creature jumped towards the woods and was gone. He was about 10 yards from the woods but made it there in less than a second. I can’t believe how fast this huge creature could move. This event traumatized me. I have never been able to go in the woods alone or enjoy camping since this event. I tried to deer hunt but could not enjoy it and quit – I can’t sit alone in a tree-stand without thinking of this creature and becoming tense. I can’t imagine coming upon this thing alone in the wilderness. I know these creatures exist. There is no doubt in my mind. I saw one up close and personal.

I heard sirens in the distance. the local rescue squad was responding to an incident. curious about what was going on I decide to go and see. when we arrived, I found out that 2 bham men had went canoeing and had not been seen since. the sherrif wanted to call for a helo to search the river. I piped up and told them that in was not a good idea. the trees cause a tunnel affect over the river. the helo wouldn't be able to see under the growth. on top of that the sun was starting to go down. he agreed and sent 6 men in 2 canoes down the river. 30-45 minutes passed and we were told that they had been found at a local bar in b'ham. my friend and I volunteered to pull the rescuers out of the river at a mid point near the road. we set off. the light was almost gone. as we made our way down the trail to a place where the stream and the cahaba meet my friend took off ahead of me. he knew the area better and i could see his light moving ahead of me. as I entered the bottoms where a bamboo thicket grew, I heard brush breaking and grunting noises to my left. I quickley made my way across the stream. I felt much better and safer once I crossed the stream. as I rejoined my friend at the intersection of the stream and river, I told him about what I had heard. he said it was probably a boar rooting for acorns. we sat for about an hour waiting. the moon was out quarter waxing, and hot as hell 100% humidity 90 degrees. after waiting I said to my friend that we must have missed the rescue team in the night. so he went to find out and he left me there on the bank to make sure they were not just slow getting down the river. another 30 minutes went by and I started seeing a light up the bank approaching my position. I pulled myself up into the foliage to camo myself, just in case the light was moon shiners or pot growers. they are notorius for bibb county. minutes passed and I heard my name being called.

The first sighting was in 1975 about 2 miles from the Chamblee Mill bridge. A friend of mine had just dropped me off after football practice. He was driving home on the road that crosses the bridge, this area is located in a triangle between Blountsville, Hanceville & Holly Pond. He saw a large black or brown hairy figure stepping out of the woods as he was coming around a curve. He was startled and almost wrecked his car. His story later appeared in the Cullman Times, a paper in Cullman, Alabama. He later told me that he never was more affraid in his life. He looked it right in the eye and it stepped back in the woods. The location he saw it at is about a mile from my childhood home.

I screamed because I was scared to death and before my husband could turn around they both stood and took off back into the woods. It did not take them not even half a second it seemed. They did not stand completely up before they bolted so I could not guess as to how tall they would have stood. They were light to medium brown and fully covered in hair. It was too quick to make out a face. Very broad shouldered and while sitting the arms did go to the ground. I begged my husband to stay home that day. It scared me so much.

As she was driving, a cow pasture on one side and steep, thick, mountainous drop offs on the other, she approached a very small, clear patch in the thick woods along the road when she noticed something just standing on the edge of the road. She quickly realized what she was seeing was definitely a sasquatch. The witness stated that it was staring at the cows in the pasture on the other side of the road. The witness actually came to a stop in the road while it was still staring at the cows, the witness stated the distance between the sasquatch and her was approx. 30-40 yards - max. It finally turned and look at the witness for approx.. 20+ seconds before taking 2 long strides out of sight. The witness stated she was so awe struck she could not speak , even to tell her child to raise up and look. I asked about how tall it was and what she used to estimate its height. The witness told me her brother is 6' 6"" tall and her father is 6' 8"" tall, she stated she knows tall when she sees it.. and the sasquatch was possibly one foot taller than her father. It had broad shoulders, at least 3, closer to 4 feet wide. Its arms hung down to mid thigh level, it had very dark, closer to black, hair. Its head size was proportionate to the body size with the hair hanging down on the shoulders. The witness went home, got her husband and returned to the sighting area. She stated her husband knew something had definitely, really upset her. They found the area where it ran into the woods, large patches of grass had been pushed down in a stepping manner. I just talked to the witness again and she confirmed it was a bright clear day",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=45464

The terrain is very steep hills and valleys in north central Alabama. Down on one of these valleys lays a deep, wide creek that has a shallow, wide spot where the deer can cross without swimming. TB arrived at this spot about 2:30 in the afternoon. He placed his stand high in the tree about 100 yds. from the deer crossing. His stand is roughly 60 yds. from the creek at its closest point. As the sun begins to fade around 4- deer come to the brush and tree line to feed. TB heard something moving through the brush at 4:30, TB notices the lack of deer movement. This is the time of day the deer should be coming out. As it approached, crossing the last few rays of sunlight, TB could see something too dark to be a deer. Stepping into his shooting corridor was a 6-7 foot tall beast with brown hair and red tint. The creature was of slender build, with heavily defined upper leg and calf muscles. The creature appeared to be female as breasts swung with each stride. The face was covered in hair, small ears and very large eyes; it walked purposely with a relaxed stride swinging the arms. The arms hung down around ¼ the length of the legs. Being high in the tree stand with camouflage and upwind the female didn’t seem to notice TB at all.

The woods went right up to the road, there was very little shoulder.

They immediately went back to look for tracks and see what it dropped. They could not find any tracks in the hard packed ground.

All of a Sudden the dogs started going crazy it woke me up so I kinda laid there thinking to myself I wish they would shut up then all of a sudden I heard one of the dogs yell out like it was hurt. Then I heard the sound of something coming up on the front porch so I sat up to look out the front window, it just so happens that we left the porch light on and what I saw was unforgettable and unbelievable. It was squatting down right in front of me I guess it was too big to stand straight up on the porch. I don't know why it was there but we had left the empty beer and soda cans and leftover food scraps in a couple of trash bags to be thrown out the next day. But to make a long story short I was no more than 8 to 10 feet away from it.

The witness had been at a family reunion, they had gathered all the trash and food scraps into trash bags on the front porch, (15’ x 15”x 9’). The trash consisted of ribs, chicken, burgers and drink cans, etc. Around 3:30 am on July 5, 2015 the witness was sleeping on the couch, right next to the porch. His cousin ""L"" was sleeping in the bedroom down the hall from the porch. The cousin heard it coming as she had seen and heard it before. Cousin ""L"" stated she just laid quietly in her bed, thinking ""I told him about this thing and he just laughed, so who’s laughing now"". She had heard it approach before and was waiting for the brothers reaction. The dog that yelped was a small dog at the back of the mobile home. Evidently it yelped when cousin ""L"" picked the dog up and put it in bed with her. (The dog being killed that was mentioned was a cousin's dog at a different location, not sure what could have killed it.) The witness stated that all the yipping little house dogs suddenly stopped their barking and went quiet. He then heard and felt the front porch groan. He sat up and cracked the blinds to see what was going on. He saw a Sasquatch come up to the porch, duck under the roof, sit down and start rummaging through the trash bags. They had left the porch light on, a 60 watt bulb, so very good visibility. As he watched this creature digging though the bags, it didn’t even get up to reach other bags. The arms were thought to be 4 - 5 ft. long, the fingers were described like Snicker bars with finger nails, and the head was shaped like the back of Darth Vader’s helmet. The hair was about 4 – 5 inches long, the hair was colored dark brown with a hint of red. The entire back was very muscular, the feet were estimated to be at least 16 inches long, and very broad. After doing some measurements it would appear the Sasquatch was about 8 1/2 feet tall and maybe 800 lbs. It had a very bad smell like cheese gone bad. The Sasquatch never did turn to where the witness could see the face. The witness was too scared to move, he’s not sure how long the creature was there. He is sure it was at least 20 minutes. His cell phone was on a charger across the room. He didn’t want to move and scare it away. When it was done it just took a leap to the ground and strode off though the yard across a 30 foot road in two strides, down a ravine and was gone. During my visit I was shown what appears to be finger and hand prints on the trailer. The fingers start at the far left side of the trailer, with the fingers closed together, and as the Sasquatch walked toward the porch the fingers began to open until at the bedroom window it became a smudge of a hand print. The fingers and hand print were at least twice the size of mine. The hand print was smudged like it had been looking in the widow and was trying for a better grip. Photos of the prints on the trailer:There is a long history of sightings in the area. It’s a sparsely populated area with just a few homes that are usually close together. There were more stories, but those witnesses couldn’t make it the day I was there. Other stories from the family include a cousin being observed as he stood next to his truck on a rural road; a close encounter by two others cousins, after almost hitting one as it entered the road in front of their vehicle; and another incident involving a young family member being chased as she delivered plates of food to her grandparents who lived nearby. Regarding the wish to kill something, I explained that we have never received a report where a Bigfoot hurt anybody. That they all have their own personalities and more likely there isn't just one in the area. I suggested that they may not take lightly to one of theirs getting shot. The folks living there who had close encounters realized at how much they look like humans, and they really couldn't kill any of them. One of the children attempted to take a photo of a Sasquatch from 200 yards, here is the photo, unfortunately it is blurry and little detail is seen: There is no doubt in my mind this was a real encounter.

We watched it for approximately 5 minutes as it appeared to look at us from the left then the right [of the tree trunk]. I dismissed it as being a distortion with the trees and wind. I turned to go into the house and looked back and distinctly saw what could only be Bigfoot running away. I yelled for my husband and he also saw it running away. It had our hearts beating wildly and the hair standing up on our arms.

Both the husband and wife said the figure must have stood approximately 8 feet tall, and its fur was very dark.

BFRO,Alabama,Colbert,577,NA,1979,NA,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"In 1979 and '80 I was living in my grandparent's old homeplace on our family farm in Alabama. The farm has about 300 acres of woods covering an area of deep hollows leading down to sloughs off of a river. In late summer and fall of '79 we had been having trouble with deer poachers and some cattle rustling on our farm, so I was spending a lot of time out at night and on my off days trying to catch them. Several times at night and a couple of times during the day I had heard strange screams back in the woods towards the river. The first time I heard them, I thought it might be a peacock or a screech owl, but it really didn't sound like either, and it seemed to be much louder and more prolonged. I really didn't think much of it until one night I was walking back to the house from the back of the farm at about 11:00pm. It was a clear night with a bright half moon shining and I could see quite well. I was skirting along the south edge of the woods about 1/2 mile due north of the house when suddenly I got a creeping feeling that I was being watched and/or was in danger. My skin started crawling and the hair on the back of my neck and hands stood up. At the same time my dog, a large doberman pinscher, started acting nervous and whining quietly and started looking back over his shoulder to our left towards the woodline. I eased the safety off on my rifle and increased my pace. Right at that instant, something screamed right in the edge of the woods less than 35 yards behind and to the left of us. The pitch and volume of the scream was incredible. I could feel my chest vibrating from the loudness of the scream. My dog and I both broke and ran to our right out into the pasture about 50 yards and I spun around and stopped with my rifle up to see if it was chasing us, but it wasn't. I stood there with my rifle up and whatever it was screamed at us five or six more times. Also I could hear movement in the dry leaves where the sound was coming from, that sounded like a large person pacing back and forth. I could also see the tops of some saplings and small trees sway and move as it bumped into them or pushed and pulled on them. The screams were longer lasting and a little lower pitched than what I had heard before. I also know for sure that they weren't bobcat screams. I became aware of the sound of our cattle running away towards the southwest. The woods got quiet but I knew it was standing there still watching me. But I never saw anything. I backed away for about 100yds and then broke into a jog back to the house, spinning around and stopping with my rifle up about every 50 yards or so to make sure it wasn't following me. A few nights later, I was up late about 1:30am and getting ready for bed. I came out of the bathroom into my bedroom and my dog was standing there staring towards the front of the house. He was completely stiff, with the hair standing up on his back and neck and he was growling very low and menacingly. It was the ONLY time I ever saw him do that and he was deadly serious. I got a glimpse of a shadow move across the corner of my front bedroom window moving towards the west side of the house. The moon was shining right on the west wall of the house. My dog turned towards the west and kept growling even more seriously. Then I saw a large, sort of human shaped shadow move across both windows on the west side of the house. The dog kept turning and growling and following the shadow. Whatever it was, had to have been about 10 feet tall to cast a shadow that far up on the windows. I was petrified with fear. I finally picked up my riot shotgun and chambered a round of buckshot. My dog, at this time, was staring towards the north window of the spare bedroom and was still stiff and but not growling quite as bad. I got up enough nerve to look out the bathroom window but saw nothing. My yard was surrounded by a 3 ft high, hog-wire fence with two strands of barbed wire on top of it and locked steel gates, so whatever it was, stepped over the fence to get into and out of my yard. The gates made a lot of noise if you tried to climb or open them, so it didn't come or go through the gates.",East of Muscle Schoals,Muscle Shoals,NA,Tennessee River,NA,NA,NA,NA,130,NA,clear,NA,NA,"pasture , 300 acres of woods , river","hardwood trees , crops",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,1,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,window peaking,NA,NA,NA,screams,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,screams sounded like peacock,1,"The witness seems to be very credible.

I had fed the horses some oats about 30 minutes earlier and I was now in the kitchen and suddenly heard a scream outside. I ran out and my wife was running in, scared nearly to death. Something was right outside the gate between the storage shed and tack room/stables screaming just like before. The horses went running out of there wide open. The fence and gate there is quite high because there is a corral there also. I could hear it moving around but could only get a glimpse of it occasionally. It was MUCH taller than the 6 ft fence there and it appeared to be black with maybe a little silver or grey mixed in.

At the time he was 18 years old and was with his cousin deer hunting on some property near his home. A tremendous ice storm had previously passed through the area, and left large tree branches on the ground. They heard a loud “pop” like an aluminum bat being hit on one of the trees or branches. They also heard footsteps, and this caused the men to turn to look behind them. A large creature stepped out from the tree line about 35 yds away. It did not move after noticing them, and just stared with squinting eyes “like someone does with poor vision after taking their glasses off.” It was described as having a large “melon shaped head”, with somewhat long, light brown hair with red highlights. The body was covered with similar hair. No nose or mouth was noticed. It stood on two legs, very long but proportionate for the body which was very massive and upright, standing about 9 feet tall. Musculature was not very noticeable due to the great amount of hair covering its body. Its feet were not noticed, being hidden by ground foliage. It made no further noise or movement toward the men. He distinctly remembers a smell associated with the sighting to be similar to rotten eggs and earthy, as well as smelling like the creature hadn’t bathed ever. He distinctly remembers being extremely frightened. He and his cousin then ran away from the creature as fast as they could. The creature did not follow. After thinking more about the visual sighting, he feels it was probably closer to 30 seconds. This witness was quite relieved to be able to tell his story after so many years. Over the past 11 years, he has talked to numerous other individuals in the area who have also had similar stories to tell like his. This witness also related an event that happened at age 21. He was at this same area camping with his cousin and had just cooked some hamburgers. His pet German Sheppard, who normally is quite aggressive and ferocious, began barking and growling at something in the nearby woods for at least 20 minutes. The dog then ran into the woods about 20 yards, and was then seen flying back out of the woods with a backward somersault, whining tremendously. The dog ran past the men out of the camp, still whining the whole time. They later found the dog back home. The cousin stated he saw something large and brown, but no other description was given.

BFRO,Alabama,Conecuh,4743,Vince Lauria,2000,February,NA,Winter,A,animal,NA,"This is a secondhand report posted by the BFRO investigators involved. Witness information withheld. The following is the witness’ account as related to Investigator Tim Cullen: At approximately 1:30 a.m. on a night in February 2000, the witness and a friend were planning to visit a girl who lived close to the sighting location. They were riding together on a motorcycle and knew they would not be able to ride up to the girl’s house without alerting her mother to their presence. They decided to hide the bike on the side of a dirt road and walk to the house from there. Very shortly thereafter, they began to hear what the witness described as very heavy walking/stomping noises. The witness described these sounds as similar to: 1. an extremely large person walking or 2. like a horse galloping only on two legs, coming from a swampy area which was northeast of their location. They squatted in the bushes and listened for a couple of minutes, at which time they determined the noise was getting closer to them and increasing in pace. At this time they decided to make a break for the motorcycle and vacate the area. The friend of the witness was in the lead and caused a branch to swing back hitting the witness in the head, knocking him down and “damn near knocking him out.” He got back up and began running after his friend all the while hearing the sounds of stomping and the crashing of underbrush getting closer to them. When he reached the spot where the motorcycle had been stashed, his friend was already pushing it out towards the road. He commented that at this time he could also hear heavy breathing which seemed to coincide with each footfall. Once they had the bike on the road, they both jumped on and his friend managed to kick start it and take off. The witness stated that he looked back just in time to see a very large creature leap from the edge of the woods out into the road. (I later measured this distance and it was a 12’ to 15’ jump, more or less.) He said it hit the road on all fours and then stood fully erect. He did comment that when the creature landed on the road, it let out an audible grunt he could hear even above the noise of the motorcycle. He said the moon was full or near full, and it was already in the western sky causing the creature to “stand in its own shadow.” Since the creature was silhouetted, he was unable to make out any detail such as facial features. However, he was emphatic that what he saw was not a bear as he’s seen bears before and they are much #8220;narrower” than what he saw (He emphasized this by hunching his arms forward and dropping his shoulders to indicate how a bear would stand and then standing fully erect with his arms out from his sides in the stance that he said he observed the creature to be in.). He said this creature was very wide and had “fluffy” hair which covered it entirely. He was unable to see any fingers on the hands although he did state that from what he could tell the hands appeared to be clenched and that the arms were longer than a human’s. He also said that from what he could see the creature appeared to be a dark brown or black color. When asked about the height of the animal, he said it was at least six to seven feet tall.

""A 6-7 ft black hairy man-like creature crossed the road in front of my truck. It looked very human but had hair hanging on it down to its hands."" ALSO NOTICED: ""It looked right at me and kept eye contact but just kept running. I heard it crashing through the trees after it ran by. Before that I had found large footprints near the river and didn't think much of it. Once I saw the creature, I knew it had made the prints I saw a few months earlier. This report was first brought to our attention after BFRO Investigator Vince Lauria gave a lecture at a country club in Alabama. A Birmingham attorney volunteered the information that a caretaker on his land had seen a bigfoot several years ago. The attorney claimed that he had never really believed bigfoot existed until his caretaker had stated that he had seen one. The attorney commented that the man has worked for him for several decades and that he was incredibly honest. “He never lied to me before, so I can’t imagine him lying about something like that.” With the exchange of names and information we were able to contact the witness and hear his story. In August of 2004 the witness was driving north on private land along the Sepulga River. It was dusk, he had been plowing fields. As he turned a bend he saw a 6-7 ft black, hairy creature cross the road from right to left. The witness said it was less than 20 feet in front of him running quickly. It looked at him, kept eye contact but never slowed down or stopped. The witness had his window down and could hear it running through the thick woods after he lost sight of it. The witness described that it had a manlike face, with very long arms. The hair was black and shaggy, and he could see the hair hanging from its hands. It was not thin, but muscular. Dark skin was visible on the face, it had a wide nose, and a conical head. When it ran, it pumped its arms. It came from the direction of the river, and appeared to be wet. The witness said he had found footprints by the river earlier in the summer and didn’t know what had made them. Once he saw the bigfoot, he then realized that it had been responsible for the prints. He has not seen or heard of one before or since that summer. He told his boss and family only. The witness, his family, Investigator Vince Lauria and I went to the location of the road crossing. It is heavily wooded, bordered by the river and farm land. It is very secluded. There is a power line road that borders the property as well. Vince recalls interviewing a Native American brother and sister that saw a bigfoot on the other side of the river less than a mile away.

Having longish hair rather than fur. She observed the hair on the head being somewhat long, and the creature having a human looking face with no hair on it. It stood erect on two legs, not moving just staring directly at her. The creature held a squealing baby pig in its arms, up against its chest in a cradle like fashion. The witness and the creature had direct visual contact for 15 seconds before she broke away to run into the house. It never turned away, never broke eye contact with her. She never heard approaching footsteps or noise of any kind, indicating something had come into the neighbor's yard, though the creature was only 25 yards away from her when she observed it. The witness is a modest and honorable individual that is left with an encounter that is imprinted vividly in her mind to this day, even after 34 years. Initially hesitant to speak in great detail for fear of ridicule, she opened up to me and revealed details of this encounter after I assured her of her anonymity. Adding to her credibility is her husband, a retired police officer of 34 years. Though he jokingly told her she saw a bear, he told me when speaking to me by phone, that he knew that his wife had seen a very large creature that day that was not a bear. He said she went into a temporary shock, and by the look on her face, and manner of her speech, knew she was telling the truth.

He stated he had told a friend of mine about his experience, and the friend gave him my telephone number and suggested he contact me. The friend is a law enforcement officer in a county that adjoins Cullman County. The LEO has seen one of the animals similar to the one described by this witness. He, his father and brother have been aggressively intimidated by similar animals on their hunting land. A few years ago he took an exceptionally good photograph of a large, man-like track left by an enigmatic primate on the property of a family member. I have had the pleasure of working closely with the friend in investigating his and other residents’ reports from that area of Alabama. I spoke with the witness several times after his first call. As a result of those conversations a few more details can be added to his original report. • The first sounds that he heard before the figure came into view were yipping and barking which he thought were made by coyotes. • Those sounds were immediately followed by whooping, a loud yelling sound and loud bipedal footsteps. • He then saw a large, dark hair-covered figure “walking hard” out of a draw to his left. • The figure was walking at an angle past him about seventy yards away when it turned left into thick brush to walk directly up slope toward the top of what is locally called Wilhite Mountain. • The witness stated the animal was in view for about two minutes. • He could hear the sounds of the animal’s travel up the mountain for a minute or so. • The animal was “dark” colored, about eight feet tall, taking long strides while leaning forward and with only moderate movement of its arms. • The animal’s upper body was very wide and thick, with little tapering to the waist line, and the head appeared large. • Facial features were not noted. The witness is believed to be a credible observer and his encounter report valid. Residents of Cullman and Morgan Counties have generated many reports of enigmatic primates during the past several years.

Her accounts were consistent and believable. Here is a sketch made by the witness: The following can be added to this report - The hair was six to eight inches long The hair was dark brown. There were leaves stuck in the hair on the buttocks. The head was very bulky. The huge size of the hands was the most remarkable visual noted by the witness. The right hand held what looked like a rock. The rock was egg shaped and almost as large in diameter as a bowling ball. The creature handled the rock as if it were a softball. The creature’s movement was powerful. The estimated height was 7’ 6”. The estimated weight was 450+ pounds. This sighting was at sunset. The witness hit her brakes and horn when she saw the deer sprint full speed across the road. She had never seen a deer run that fast. As the car was stopping, she saw the creature coming to a stop near the roads edge. The headlights started to light up the creature as it turned to its left and walked back into the pine forest. She slowly drove forward until she was at the point where the creature entered the forest. Her window was down and she could smell a very strong, musty odor with the power of skunk. She could also hear the creature making deep, raspy, loud grunts. When she looked for the source of the grunts she could see the creature about 50 feet inside the wood line facing her car. These grunt unnerved the witness and she drove home. I met with the witness the afternoon after the encounter where the sighting took place. The pine forest was thick with trees from 3” to 12” in diameter. The ground was covered with a thick layer of pine needles so no tracks could be found. I did find deep scuff marks near the roads edge where she said the deer sprinted across the road. We stayed road side for about an hour as it started getting dark. There was a huge storm front moving in and lightning could be seen flashing on the horizon. I decided to make two quick whoops to see if there would be any response. Two seconds later there was a faint response that we both heard. The response was of the same cadence and tone I had used. We stayed there in the dark for about 20 minutes then left because the storms were getting close The witness went back to the site alone 2 days later. She started to smell the same odor again after about 10 minutes. The odor started getting stronger after another 2 minutes so she left and did not go back.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=45296
BFRO,Alabama,Dale,22899,Kevin Smykal,1992,April,NA,Spring,B,animal,NA,"I was assigned to Ft Rucker, AL from Oct 1991 until Jan 1997 as a fire fighter. As military firefighters we would often be assigned to small airfields (stagefields) around Ft Rucker. At the time this happened I was assigned to Tabernacle stagefield. Tabernacle was on the north west end of a large impact area used for aerial gunnery by pilots in training. During a typical duty day we would have several down time periods where aircraft were not flying. These down time periods would typically take place around noon and evening lasting 2.5 to 3 hours. When I was assigned to Ft Rucker, I had met some other Soldiers that introduced me to Indian “relic” hunting. This consisted mostly of lots of walking through tilled fields, creek washouts, and recently cleared timber tracts looking for arrowheads and anything else related to the old Indian tribes that formally lived in the south east Alabama region. I had found that the down times when aircraft were not flying often granted me the chance to get out in the woods to hunt for arrowheads. Often I was able to get several miles away from the stage field during the down times and was usually by myself for several hours. My typical hiking outfit was to put on a pair of cargo shorts, an old pair of army boots, a belt with a canteen, a pouch (for any finds), a large survival knife, ball cap and a walking stick. I usually would not wear a shirt hoping to get a tan while out walking. This day in particular was in I left my stage field around 1100 AM or so. I headed East, North East for about 1.5 miles on an improved asphalt road that bordered the impact area. I then head north down a dirt road (path was more like it) that was seldom traveled. The road went up and down some gentle hills and was bordered on both sides by heavy vegetation and thick woods. I believe I had walked maybe ¾ of a mile when I was approaching a small creek crossing which was not unusual. I was maybe within 50 feet of the creek when off to my left side I heard a lot of movement approximately 150-200 feet into the woods appearing to come from the creek bank. I heard what I can only describe as a grunt and my first though was a wild pig. That thought was quickly erased though, as I immediately got instant chills…goosebumps running my entire body…and had the heavy feeling that I was not alone. I heard another grunt and peered into the woods from where the sound came from and saw a large “shadow”…easily 6 to 7 foot tall stand from the creek bed. Because of the thick woods I got no clear view of it but my first thought was that it was a large very dirty man but it definitely had the appearance of a man shape. I only saw this thing for a few seconds as it appeared to see me…and me watching it and it turned and went crashing into the woods away from me. I wasted no time turning my walk into a trot away from what I had just seen. Whatever it was it scared me and as I headed back to my airfield I tried to make sense of it. The only thing I could conceive it being was that maybe it might have been a stray horse back in the woods. I know this sounds very unlikely but I really didn’t want to believe I might have seen something I could not explain…a horse in the woods I could almost believe. I never went back into that area of the woods again, and seldom ventured into thick woods period after that. I never gave it much thought after that as I had chalked it up as being a horse, which seemed to make sense to me. I did bring my strange experience up a couple of times to some folks but they thought I was kidding them and none of them had ever heard of anything like that in Alabama before. Two things led me to revise my thinking of what I saw that day. The first being this. In 2000…I was and am still living in Kansas and serving in the Army Reserve. We had a new Soldier join my unit. He was a former Ranger Sniper team leader having been assigned to the Ranger battalion at Ft Lewis, WA. He was a good old country boy from Kansas living in a small town. He and I became very good friends and later served in Iraq together. We would often talk about events in our lives at length. During one conversation I related my story about what I saw in the woods assuming he would think I was nuts. But…he believed me. As a matter of fact he said if I saw something I found hard to believe he said that I should just go with what my gut told me. He then informed me about his experiences. He told me about his time up at Ft Lewis and as a sniper he would often be in the woods alone for days at a time in hide sites during training missions. He told me that at night in the deep woods he would often feel as if he was being watched and would hear the sounds of something large moving through the woods. Now this fellow was an experienced woodsman and was used to the sounds and smells of the woods. On occasion he was able to see something quite large in the shape of a man moving around his hide site through his night vision goggle. He said it would never come too close…just kind of checking him out. He said he never felt threatened by it and on the occasion it would make some sounds (grunts or whistles) as if it was agitated and he would talk calmly too it. He said that he wood talk in a slow, low voice telling it “I’m not here to hurt you, just calm down, I don’t mean no trouble for you”. He said that usually after he spoke towards it, it would just move away from him and would leave him alone. He said this happened numerous times as he was often in the same area. He told me he had no doubts at all that “Bigfoot” was around but he would never do anything to harm it and he felt that if left alone it would not harm anyone. So that got me to thinking, maybe that afternoon in the woods I really did see a Bigfoot. The second reason I feel that I didn’t see what I convinced myself was a horse is that after culling the BFRO website I found that I am not the only one to have seen something in Alabama. So…I am not alone and I am now convinced that what I saw was real…and not something else. I haven’t shared this story with very many people…but maybe this is the time to do it",NA,Fort Rucker,Military Roads,Fort Rucker,NA,NA,NA,NA,1130,NA,clear,NA,NA,wooded,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,1,6.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,dark,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,moving from river to the woods,NA,NA,bipedal,grunting,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"The witness is a 37 year old male.

In the written report he stated that he saw a large "" shadow"". During our phone conversation he stated that he did actually see the creature, albeit briefly.

BFRO,Alabama,Dale,34224,Brad Sasser,2011,April,NA,Spring,B,animal,NA,"It was April of 2011. My son, daughter-in-law, wife and I had been over at my in-laws having dinner. My son and his wife and their infant son had recently moved in with us. We were in the process of adding a new laundry room and garage on the back side of our house. When we came in from next door my son and his family were ahead of my wife and me by a minute or two. I noticed the lights to the new addition were on and figured that one of them had gone out to retrieve their laundry. I opened the back door and said is anyone out there. I didn’t yell so I thought they might not have heard me. I stepped out on the patio and started walking toward the garage that didn’t have a door hung yet. As I did I saw a dark figure at the back of our SUV. It scared me that there was “someone” in, or had just passed through our garage. Without saying another word I ran back into the house to get my 410 shotgun and let me son know to join me outside. This only took 30 seconds or less. I went back out but this time I was yelling “if there is someone out there you better speak up or I am going to shoot you.” My son joined me and we ran out into the yard both yelling for the person to identify themselves. We circled our house and saw nothing. It had rained earlier in the afternoon and evening and as we came back to re-enter our house confident that what I had seen ran away we noticed footprints on the concrete patio deck. These footprints at first looked like that of foot gloves people that fit each toe like a glove does the hand. But the thing that was conspicuous was the size. They were enormous. Not only long but wide, huge like that of what an NBA star might leave. (I say that because I have a pair of shoes owned by an NBA star that my nephew gave me who is on an NBA coaching staff.) My point, these were very large feet and very wide strides. It then dawned on me how large the figure I saw in the garage had to be. As stated I own an SUV and at the back part of the garage where I saw the figure the concrete starts to slope down from the garage. This figure I saw was head and shoulders over the top of the SUV and he (it) was already on the slope because he was not inside the garage when I saw him. I joked to my son and later to my family; you know that thing I saw that night was big enough to be a Sasquatch. We all laughed because we had not heard of any other Bigfoot sightings in lower Alabama. Then your show comes to television and I go on your site today and learn that there was indeed a Bigfoot sighting on Ft. Rucker back in the 90’s by a solder. I live just five to six miles from the post. I’m not convinced that what I saw should be reported to you but I do know that if it was a person I never want to see them again on a dark night in my yard because they are a very big person.

The SUV was parked in the garage with the rear of the vehicle at the entrance of the garage. The witness saw the back upper torso, shoulders, and head of the creature. This entire time of observation was five seconds from a distance of approximately twenty five feet. There was no description of arms, lower torso, and legs as they were blocked from view by the vehicle. During this encounter there was a light on in the garage that allowed the witness to notice this detail. However, no face detail was noted, other than the absence of visible ears, because the animal was observed from behind. The witness estimates the height of his SUV at around six foot six inches. The creature in question would have been over a foot taller than the top of the SUV according to witness observation, placing the animal at around eight foot tall. As stated, after about five seconds of observation the witness ran inside. After returning outside with his son the witness noticed three footprints left on his concrete drive due to the animal walking onto the driveway from the wet grass caused by the evening rain. He describes them as looking like a man’s footprint. The witness is fortunate enough to own a shoe once worn by an NBA player. The shoe in question is a size sixteen and the witness states the wet footprint wouldn’t fit into the shoe. He said the width of the print stood out as being wider than the foot that would have been in the size sixteen shoes. He also estimates the distance between the footprints at around four feet with the total distance covered in three steps at just over twelve feet. The area around the witness’ property is wooded with intermittent farms and fields. The animal would have had to cover an area of around seventy-five yards in order to reach the wood line from where the witness observed the creature. According to the witness he was in the house about thirty seconds. I found this witness to be articulate and forthcoming and believe he is credible. In my opinion there is land nearby that would support such animals and there is an abundance of game in the area. The land I reference is Ft.

I could not see any facial features but they're arms were long for their bodies. They appeared to hesitate as though they couldn't decide what to do as I approached them in my car. All of a sudden they ran across the road in front of me and vanished into the thick bushes and trees on the other side of the road. They did not stoop over but ran upright and with swiftness. I was stunned. They were no animal I had ever encountered before. I started to slow down and get out of my car, but all of a sudden it hit me. I've seen something that can't be explained other than these creatures are not normal creatures. I was spooked and the hair stood up on the back of my neck.

Firstly concerning the trail. He said it was a kind of path that connected a neighborhood with a local grocery store. This trail was bordered by woods all around which could provide plenty of cover for a large bipedal creature to come and go without detection. Also, very near the trail where the encounter occurred is the grocery store dumpster, containing thrown out food. This very well could be the reason this creature was encountered at this location. Now concerning the encounter. The witness said he remembered falling off his bike, looking up and seeing this large, brown hairy creature. He estimated that it was ten feet from him, looking directly at him when it let out a loud howl/growl that terrified him. I asked him about facial and bodily features, other than what he stated in his report. He distinctly remembered the mouth being wide open as it howled/growled, displaying human-like teeth, only larger. The howl/growl was deep yet pitched, and lasted a few seconds. He said it sounded like nothing he has ever heard. Immediately after this it turned and walked off the trail into the woods at a high rate of speed. As it moved through the woods, the witness remembers hearing branches snapping. The witness then got up, climbed on his bike and rode home as fast as he could, where he hid in his house, fearfully peeking out the window hoping the creature did not follow him home. The witness seemed very credible to me. He was clear about the details he remembered and did not try to embellish or add to it. To this day the witness has not returned to the site of the encounter. This says something to me seeing he is a veteran of the Marine Corps, and a career Firefighter.

They had been going in and out of the house to cut boards by the light of a pole light outside. The son carried one board in and the witness grabbed a second board, as he did he looked out over the backyard. The outside light cast a shadow over the trees in the backyard. As he looked around he noticed a raunchy smell like something dead. Then he noticed that he had one too many trees in the yard. The “tree” took a step and a half crossing the 10 ft. wide path of light. The creature was 8ft tall, about 500lbs, graying hair like you get as you get older with patches of dark brown. The creature was very muscular with knee length arms. The witness, a fifteen-year marine veteran, stated that he had seen a lot of things, but not once did he think of grabbing a gun and going to look for tracks. He knew what he saw. Two nights later his brother who is a pastor saw the same creature cross between his truck and a car in front of him in his headlights. Two nights after that the witness and his 27 year-old son were leaning against the tail gate of the pickup, as they looked across the yard. The son said ""there’s a little one at the edge of the woods"". As they watched the “little one” stood up to be the 8ft adult that was seen four nights before. Shortly after that, a few days later, the nieces came running in screaming, saying something was after them and had been throwing rocks at them. The witness and his brother grabbed two rifles a 30-06 and an AR-15. They stood on the pool deck looking around to see what was going on. The longer they stood the more the cool night air took its toll. The witness started inside only to hear his brother a pastor of many years exclaim s**t. The brother stated that when he moved to go in, the creature also moved from behind the tree it had been watching from. The brother was wide-eyed with disbelief as he was told ""welcome to the club"". Since that first night the witness posted on Facebook for the world to see, not caring what people thought because he KNEW. He received a call from his neighbor. That same night as the witness saw the creature; she couldn’t sleep and had gone out to her deck. While on the deck she observed what was apparently the same creature eating pears from her tree. Since then he has had many people step forward with their own sightings. The witness has had 6in diameter trees torn apart, rocks, dirt and other objects thrown in their direction.

My headlights lit up the reflectors on the guard rails all the way down them. About mid way down the rail I saw a black space, almost like a gap in the rail. Once I got a little closer I realized it was some type of animal. It looked hairy, and as if it were standing over the rail crossing it.

I pulled out onto the highway (same one I had the first sighting on) and as soon as I pulled out about 200 to 300 yards I saw something weird looking on the side of the road, something out of place. As I started down the road it slowly walked out on the highway and took its time walking across the road, then stepped over the guard rail (same one as first sighting). It did this with ease. It walked down the ditch and into the woods. At this point it was about 150 yards in front of me. Its pretty open where it walked out so I got an okay look at it, but it was still a couple hundred yards out. Things that caught my attention were the way it seemed to walk. It had short legs and a longer upper body. Its head stuck up away from the shoulders. The arms hung beside it and hands were nearly touching the knees. It was all black. At first sight I was just like, that's a man, but the closer I got the more I realize how different it looked. How much bigger it appeared. Plus it came from the woods, walked across the road into a swampy area. With no cars or anyone around. It just seemed out of place to me. That's what made me focus on more detail. You could tell it didn't have clothes on because it was just one slick figure. Not baggy from jackets/ pants/ etc. Not to mention it was rainy and around 30 degrees that morning. Whatever it was, I had never seen and I hunt all the time in the woods. But I will say it was defiantly not a bear or any human I've ever seen before. This thing was big and it gave you a chill just seeing it. I'm going back tomorrow to see if I can find any hair that may of caught the rail or any tracks, just anything that catches my eye.

I stood there and heard a noise and the deer that had ran by came back by as if something had spooked them again. As they came back up the hill I heard what appeared to be a large animal coming from the thicket. I thought it was another deer that had separated from the herd and was coming back to join up. As I watched something on two legs appeared roughly 100ft from my position from out of the thicket. It came down the fence line and went over the fence in the direction of the deer.

It was middle of summer and the Mosquitoes were really bad so I decided to wait until after dark to go because they usually calm down after sunset. I had been fishing awhile with no luck when I started noticing something moving in the edge of the water, it was a river otter. I had never seen one before so I just sat and watched it for awhile. It was eating something maybe crawfish or muscles, I'm not sure but it was there for quite awhile. While watching it I started noticing large yellow eyes that I assumed was an owl. I would just catch a glimpse of them and when I would turn to look at them they would disappear. This went on for 30-45 minutes. All of a sudden the otter shot away from the bank and I saw something grey move from behind a bush to behind a cedar tree. The distance it covered was about 15 feet and it did it in a second and made no noise.

These were trails that myself as well as the other neighborhood kids frequented often on bikes as well as foot. It was a sunny day and warm. After going approxiametly 60 yards into the woods I looked up onto a hill that was to the left of the trail that we were traveling on. There standing, looking directly at us, among some small pine trees, was a very large being. It was standing straight up on two legs, it was huge, at least 7ft tall, covered with medium brown hair. It was standing as if frozen, I can still picture its arms and hands for some reason; his hands were just like a man's except larger and covered with hair. It's face was not totally covered with hair. I froze in place and whispered to my cousin ""what is that?"". She thought I had seen something on the ground she was not looking on the hill. I just took off running as fast as I could toward the road, out of the woods.

The sighting took place in an area that is very isolated with no houses or roads. There are more than 600 square miles of forest with very few roads and almost no homes from the sighting location, westward. The witness had to hike to his fishing spot. The creek where the sighting took place is actually a long, narrow, winding man-made lake about 200 yards wide. He had been fishing in the dark for about 15 minutes when the fighting sounds started. For about 30 minutes, the two animals were running left and right about 60 yards each way as they worked their way down hill towards the witness. The sound of tree limbs being ran through and broken was accompanied with growling and hollering. The two would stop frequently and to the witness it sounded as if they were fighting each other. Being a mature, lifelong outdoorsman, he could tell there was no way it could be deer or humans fighting. When he could tell they were in a clearing near the waterline across from his location, he illuminated them with a powerful spot light. The light illuminated the left side of two 7’-7.5"" tall bipeds facing the same direction (90 degrees to the witness). They had dark skin. Their shoulders were very wide and both had large buttocks and hands. They were very lean and muscles could be seen in action.

The head was down, and both arms were extended forward searching through the grass with hands as if looking for something. It was not digging. The hair was black, with no highlights. His first impression was that it was a young person in a costume on the side of the road, but he ruled this out quickly since the skin and hair fit tightly to the body. The creature did not turn to look at them, but rather kept searching through the grass. The face was not seen.

BFRO,Alabama,Lee,7427,NA,2000,January,5,Winter,A,animal,NA,"On approx. January 5, 2000, three friends and I decided to camp on one of my friend's land. We had two fourwheelers and a dog with us. It was a rainy day and the ground of surrounding area was significantly wet. We decided to camp anyway. It stopped raining about dusk when my friend and I started to pitch the tent, while the other two went back to there house for some more supplies. Mind you we were only camping about a mile from the road and one and a half miles from the landowner's home. About ten minutes after their departure me and my friend started hearing strange grunts, foul smell, and heavy footsteps. It went on for about ten minutes, with sounds getting closer and at random, as though the ""animal"" was trying to scare us or get us to make a move. It stopped when my friends arrived back and we dismissed as deer, spooked by our presence. We told of the incident to our friends and the landowner's son explained that his dad had been experiencing ""strange"" occurences lately. We went on with our camping and rode four-wheelers for about two hours. When we arrived back at camp, we decided to stay for the rest of the night. About ten minutes after arriving back, the same strange grunts and heavy steps began again. This time they were more aggitated and frequent. The sounds came within at least twenty yards of our camp. The area is heavily wooded so I could not see the animal at this time. The animal was across the creek at the beginning of the sounds and eventually jumped down into the creek, about a seven foot drop, and stayed there making grunts and heavy steps there for about five to ten minutes. Being very frightened and defensive, I picked up about a ten pound rock and threw it in the vicinity of the animal below in the creek. I could not see the animal due to the foliage. It must have hit the animal because it gave a loud shriek and ran up the creek away from us, then jumping back up on the bank, a seven foot jump, and running back behind our campsite. It then proceeded to make very loud grunts and ran around the back of the campsite about twenty yards away in the woods out or our fire's sight. It then stopped and we could hear it breathing heavily. Talking amongst ourselves and shouting at the animal, it then made the most blood-curdling scream I have ever heard. I would describe it as high-pitched and seemed to echo everywhere around us. I have heard bobcats and screech owls and can tell you this was not one. We then proceeded to leave hasitly on our ATVs and went and got the father of my friend. He came back with us and stayed awhile with no occurences. He left and we somehow got ourselves to stay for the night. Nothing happened the rest of the night and we went to sleep. I awoke at 3am to the same grunts and heavy footsteps. This time they were very close. They lasted by my watch til 345am. Not awaking my friends in fear of the animal becoming aggressive, I laid there and listened to this animal. Afterwards, I laid there until sunrise and told my friends of the sounds and occurences of the night. They asked me due to my, as they described, pale face and rattled demeanor. We then went and looked for any evidence of the animal. We found locks of hair in the trees, approx. seven foot high, and numerous large footprints, similar to a humans, but with no arch and a very large great toe. We then proceeded to follow the footprints to where, amonst downed trees and foliage, we found where a large animal had been laying. We found hair there also. We continued to trail the animal's leavings when came across the same sounds of footsteps. They were too scared to go over the hill and see the animal making the noise so they told me to. Reluctantly I did, and saw a large upright creature, approx. seven to eight feet tall, walking with its back to me. It was covered in hair, black to dark brown, and had an awful smell. It turned and alarmed by my presence ran away from me. I then turned and ran away from it towards my friends who I shouted to to run. They got up and ran and we ran back to our campsite and stayed there where I told them what I saw. For a few months after that we heard the same grunts and shrieks down the creek where we camped that night. We frequently rode ATVs down there and an occurence was frequent. Occurences also happened at other places, two to three miles away from the area of occurence. A sighting was also reported at a park about a mile up the road from my house, three miles from the creek. We also found footprints in nearby rock quarry. My brother and I also saw a ""brown"" animal, who we thought to be a man at first, but, trailed him to find that could not have been a man, on hunting land a mile from our house.

The witnesses described how they were camping on land belonging to one of the families. They had never experienced anything remotely close to what they experienced that night. While two of the witnesses left the area, two of the four stayed behind and began working on erecting a tent. It was then that they first began hearing strange sounds and began smelling a rancid odor (which persisted through much of the night). Keep in mind that these young men all grew up in the vicinity and were well used to all the sounds of the forest. These sounds were uniquely peculiar in that they sounded almost human-like. The witnesses “heard something like a person” 20 – 30 yards away just after the sun had gone down. What they were hearing was similar to the sounds of ""someone walking around."" It was now “pitch dark.” A campfire was burning and flashlights and ATV lights were in use. The sounds began to evoke images of someone “stomping around or jumping.” The two young men now found themselves getting “spooked.” Whatever it was, it remained just out of sight and across the creek. Then, the two began hearing “deep growls.” The young men's dog, a cocker spaniel, was decidedly uncomfortable with the disquieting visitor. The witnesses remarked that the dog was extremely nervous, whiney and afraid through out the evening. When the other two witnesses arrived back on the scene, the sounds seemingly stopped. A while later, the sounds (“stomping, jumping, and growling”) resumed, this time all four of the young men heard them. The sounds continued for approximately 15 minutes, then the unseen entity sounded as though it jumped into the creek and began approaching the young men. At that time, the witnesses, already scared, now became defensive and began shouting (still thinking – indeed hoping it to be human) at the intruder, ordering it to not come any closer. The primary witness indicated that at that time he picked up a large rock and threw it toward the unknown and unseen harasser. The stone must have hit its target or came very close, because the unidentified tormentor shrieked and hysterically ran around the campsite, the whole time the young men hearing its loud panting and breathing. Once it stopped, the witnesses decided to end the stand off and defiantly began to approach the creature. The animal then produced a scream that “sounded like a woman but much more high-pitched.” The primary witness stated that the scream was so loud that it actually made his “ears hurt.” The witnesses immediately left to retrieve one of their fathers. When the witnesses returned, all activity had ceased. The father witnessed nothing of the sort that the young men had witnessed and casually dismissed the incident. The young men were still not sure of what they had encountered. The father managed to calm the young men down, and they reluctantly decided to stay the rest of the night at the campsite. I asked the witnesses why they would choose to return and stay there after having endured such a harrowing experience. The said they all lived there and knew the woods well, and that the animal could have been anything, and they believed that the game of torment was over. Into the night, the primary witness awoke to more noises, but he chose to try to ignore the sounds. He remained awake until the sun came up. When the other young men awoke the next morning, they combed the area for indications of what had tormented them during the night. The witnesses found large humanlike footprints “15 – 16 inches in length with five toes,” and an area where something large had created a nest with a crude, rudimentary roof of tree branches. Also in the area around the nest, they found dark hairs. Apparently they began to hear noises again, and the primary witness “crept” up a small hill and peered over it, only to see a “large, hairy animal” with its back facing him. The animal was at a distance of 30 – 40 yards. It turned once and looked at the witness and then ran off. The witness described the creature as being “dark brown,” and “around seven feet tall,” with a face that “looked like a gorilla.” At that time, the witness thought to himself, “So this is what a bigfoot looks like.” The father came to the campsite and inspected the area. He listened to the testimony of the primary witness and looked at the tracks. He then told the young men that he believed they had been harassed by a bigfoot",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=7427
BFRO,Alabama,Lee,18033,Morris Collins,2002,May,30,Spring,B,animal,NA,"One evening my wife and I decided to go to my hunting club property to a place where we used to go sit and talk. We got there just before dark and had been there for several hours when it happened. The place where we were is on a large power transmission line right of way.There is a small stream that crosses the clearing, and a very steep hill on the side where we parked. In fact, so steep that it is difficult to drive a four wheel drive down to the stream. On the other side of the stream there is a low level spot that then becomes another steep hill. I would say that the hills are a good 50 feet higher than the stream. I had parked my truck on the hilltop, and we sat on the tailgate facing the stream. Around 11:00 pm we heard a very loud snorting noise coming from the bottom of the hill, and the sound of brush moving and breaking. I thought that it was a wild hog, because they are plentiful in this area, so I told my wife to get in the truck, because I was afraid it would attack us. She got in the truck while I tried to find my flashlight and my gun. When she slammed the door, I heard a loud, low growl/grunt and it sounded like something large started running up the hill towards us. I was standing in the bed of my truck by now trying to shine my light down the hill, but the batteries were weak and I couldn't see very far.There was a very bright moon out so I turned off my light, and could see a large shadow moving around about halfway up the hill towards us. I was listening to it move around and make the same growl/grunt noise. I could also hear what sounded like breathing noises. I then caught scent of a strange, musky, sour odor and heard more brush breaking and what sounded like stomping noises. I was certain by now that this was not a wild hog, but couldn't figure out what it might be. So I told my wife to start my truck and rev the engine a few times and when she did, I heard what sounded like something crashing through the brush heading down hill and moving fast. We were both a little spooked by now so we left. As I pulled out onto the dirt road off the power line trail, I turned toward the bridge that crosses the small stream (the road roughly parallels the power line) a large number of deer ran at high speed across the road,heading away from the stream.

The witness returned to the sight 3 days later and found pine saplings had been pulled up including the roots and thrown up slope in the direction of where he had been parked. Due to rains, there were no prints noted. The witness remembered times when the dogs used to run deer would either refuse to get out of the truck or would cease to chase deer and return to the trucks and try to get back in their boxes. He also remembered hunting with two other members who had placed two deer carcasses in a creek to keep cool until later in the day.

BFRO,Alabama,Lee,18376,Morris Collins,2007,January,30,Winter,B,animal,NA,"First of all I would like to say that I am a city girl and educated in medical science and not familiar with such things as Big Foot. I will say that I moved to Alabama 6 years ago, met and married my husband and he familiarized me with ""the ways of the wild""...ie sounds, smells, woods, etc. I learned as much about the outdoors as I could and visit them often to this day. The experience I am about to share occured in January 2007. My husband belonged to a hunting club and we spent most of our free time enjoying waterfalls and creeks....looking at stars...sitting and talking, absolutely everything slips away when you go into the wild. We decided not to go to the hunting club this night, but to an old abandoned grave yard. An elderly couple used to go there years ago and keep it clean from debris and weeds but since they died it is grown over. It seems to be such a peaceful place full of history and romance. We had been there often and this particular night my husband was, to say the least, enebriated, and we were just sitting in the car talking...the moon was very bright and the stars were all out. I kept hearing branches breaking, to my left, I was in the driver seat of the car and my husband was in the passenger seat. I thought it was probably a rabbit or another critter of the night...but I started to get a very creepy feeling...as if I was being watched...I felt this for a time before my husband asked me why I was looking to my left constantly. I simply said I feel like I am being watched and shrugged it off. The feeling did get stronger and I continued to look to my left into the surrounding woods to find out exactly what was giving me this eerie feeling. This went on for quite a while...I also noticed a foul odor but could not pin point it's source..I thought it was my husbands usual bout of, well to put it delicately, indigestion...I eventually saw a very tall figure and told my husband that someone was in the woods and he was standing between two tall pine trees...He thought I was crazy and laughed it off...I never stopped looking and saw this figure sway from side to side...from tree to tree..never approached...never made a sound. I looked for about 5 or 10 minutes before I was just too scared to stay there anymore, so we left. A similar experience happened to my husband 5 years ago right after I moved here. It is currently posted on this site. I have been encouraged by Mr. M. Collins to post my experience..throughout this experience my husband never witnessed what I saw. He says he could not see anything out in the dark because of the glare of the dashboard lights (we had the radio on low). I am not sure what exactly I did see...I just know that I have frequented these woods for years and have never felt like that before...I do not intimidate easily and I was extremely ready to leave that night. I have gone back to the graveyard, but not nearly as often as before the incident. I am always on guard there.

While not a long time outdoors person, she has spent the last few years going into her husbands leased hunting preserve with him. She is no longer comfortable going into the woods or into this area even with her husband and myself.

The witness is quite sure of what she observed. After marking the trees she indentified with tape, and using her husband as a reference (he is 5'11""), the witness feels sure that the creature that she saw observing them was 7 feet tall or at least a foot taller than her husband. Photos of the area and the trees where she observed the creature have been taken. The distance from where the witness was in her car to the trees she observed the creature is about 15 meters. While the brush looks thick from the road, the underbrush is quite thin and would allow a fairly large animal to move unobstructed within the tree line. The shape was that of a man but much more bulky and taller. The head appeared to set directly on the shoulders. The witness also recalled a smell similar to rotten eggs during the encounter. The only other item she recalled was the presence of what she thought was reflected moonlight from what appeared to be eyes. She compared the color to that of a dog with cataracts in appearance.

I was on an annual family visit to my Grandparents place in Athens. We had gone out to ""the River"" for a few days. I can't recall what day it was but I do remember that is was in the early afternoon. I was a typical kid then so naturally I was doing kid stuff. I had a Frog gig and I was downat the boathouse pier throwing it into the shallow water trying to randomly hit something in the water. ( I did nail a Crappie but, I did not hurt it bad so I let it go). At the end of the slew was a swampy area. This area started approx. 175 to 250 yards from my Grandparents cabin. It was shallow water and several hardwood trees such as Oak or Dogwood, for example, growing within the swamp. The swamp went back perhaps a few miles. (No one in my family nor myself, except maybe my Grandfather, had ventured too far into that swamp). Along the sloping bank from the cabin to the swamp were 3 other cabins with piers. Across from the cabins is a gentle sloping pasture, next to it are a couple of cabins and boathouses. It seems that every time I was at the boathouse and I looked across the water there were always cows in the pasture. However, that day I just let the Crappy go and I happened to look out toward the swamp. As i did I noticed something emerge from the swamp, next to and below the pasture fence about 50 feet, and wade into the water of the slew. It was dark in color, black I think,( this I know because it was a sunny day), it stood upright. It had waded into the water ""knee"" deep. I did not really pay attention at first thinking it was a Bear. However, I looked again a few seconds later and soon realized it was not a bear. It was tall, approx. 8 or 9 feet, well built, and very hairy. I could not make out any facial features due to the distance, I did not notice a neck and the head was round shaped. The animal proceeded to look both ways, it then bent over at the waist and took its left arm and swung it into the water. I noticed the splash. The animal did this twice. It then stood up and looked straight in my direction. It stood there a few seconds then turned around and walked back into the swamp just like a person would. I stood there and just of shrugged my shoulders and went back to messing around. About 3 or 4 minutes later I looked back toward the swamp again and the creature came back out from the same spot that it had before. It waded ""knee"" deep into the water once again and did the exact same thing over that it had done before, including looking my direction once again. It then turned around and wandered back into the swamp in the same area it had come out of. It did not come back out again, for I stayed at the pier for about another hour and I keep looking that-a-way several times. To this day I am convinced that it was trying to catch fish. I never felt I was in any danger even though it was an odd experience. However, being at that age I did not want to go outside alone after dark for any reason including to use the bathroom. ( The cabin bathroom was in the basement and one had to get to it by going outside). It took me a few years too be comfortable there at night. In regards to that sighting there was something I noticed, there were no cattle to be seen in the pasture at the time of the sighting! The funny side to all this is that I had carried a pair of binoculars down to the pier with me and left them sitting next to me on the upper rail. Not once did it occur to me to pick them up and use them! A side note Two weeks earlier two boys had found large human like footprints in that region somewhere as reported in a local newspaper. About ten years ago my Grandmother sold the place. However, I was in Athens a couple of years ago so I drove out to ""the River"" too see the old place. No one was there so I took the liberty of walking downto the pier and boathouse. Except for a new paint job on the cabin and a refurbished boathouse nothing had changed over the years. The slew and swamp were still the same. I remained for an hour picking up fossils since the water was down, it being late summer. During that brief time I looked toward the swamp periodically remembering, wondering, and well, kind of hoping",Elk Creek 12 miles northwest of Athens,Athens,NA,Elk Creek,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,clear,NA,NA,"swamp , forest , lake","hardwood trees , oak trees , dogwood trees",NA,NA,NA,14.63,48.0,16,NA,1,8.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,black,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,round,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,"round head , no neck",NA,"knee deep in water then bent at waist and used left arm to swing in the water , left into the woods , came back and did the same thing",NA,NA,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=799

BFRO,Alabama,Limestone,15597,Kevin Smykal,2006,July,28,Summer,B,vocalization,NA,"I had purchased a fence for my cats and my husband and I had spent most of the day putting it up .We stopped working on it that evening so we could have time to feed the animals-horses,dogs chickens and cats- before dark . By the time we were finished feeding everything it was dark but I had decided to run a cord with a light on it out to the fence and work on it a while longer adding more clips to it . The local high school is about 1 or 1 1/2 miles from our house and they were having a tractor pull that night and I could hear the noise from the tractors .Other than that, it was quiet out . The fence is out close to the barn which has a security light on it . With that light and the light on the cord that I had hanging from one of the tall fence post, the area where I was working was well lit . I had been working for about 2 hours when I heard a noise coming from the woods to my left about 100 or 150 yards away . There is a deer trail that runs through the woods there and the noise I heard sounded like something had caught a deer . I continued putting clips on the fence, not thinking anything else about the noise I had heard and about 25 or 30 minutes later at about 100 yards up from the place I had heard the first noise, I heard something make a loud hollering howling sound . Not wanting to believe what I heard, I told myself that it had to have been the neighbors dog . They have a huge dog that has a hoarse bark . Anyway, I decided it was time for me to go inside . I gathered up my tools and just as I was about to get on the four wheeler, I heard it holler,howl again . This time the sound came from the area where I had heard the first noise, that sounded like the deer had been caught . I didn't take time to turn the four wheeler around . I backed it all the way back to the house, right up to the back door .I jumped off, ran in and locked the door .I was shaking so bad I could barely stand . It was like I was having a nightmare, I couldn't believe what I had heard . I told my husband and we went back out with the gun but we didn't hear anything . I knew what I had heard sounded like the sound the bigfoot made on the programs I had watched on TV and at first I even thought I was crazy for even thinking that that's what it could have been and Iv'e tried my best to convince myself there's no way it could have been a bigfoot but it hasn't worked . My husband keeps saying that he believes I had heard something and that there's a good explanation for it because there's no such thing as a bigfoot . He hasn't been able to give me a good one yet . I have called the local game warden and tried to mimic the sound I had heard asking him if he knew of any animal in this area that would make this sound and he said no . He did say that the only thing he could think of might be some sort of canine - a coyote or if it was more of a high pitched sound it might be a fox . Please believe me this was no coyote, no fox, no small animal could make a sound like the one I heard . It was 100 or 150 yards away and it sounded like it was standing right behind me . I could tell that it was coming from something very large because of the power behind the sound and the sound it's self was like a loud Ahoooooooo .There's no way anyone could have been in the woods faking this . It was real . This experience has affected me big time . My doors are closed and locked now day and night - I don't think a locked door would stop it, but I lock them anyway . If I'm at home alone during the day and I need to go outside for anything, I carry a gun with me . Under no circumstances do I go outside at night now . I'm afraid to sleep at night . I'm scared to death here now . I don't know for a fact that what I heard was a big foot but I believe with everything inside me that it was . When I found this sight on the internet and listened to the sounds that had been recorded, I swear to you, I started shaking all over again . It sounded exactly like what I had heard- Exactly- except what I heard was very close to me. This is the bad part of it all - When I called the game warden to tell him what I had heard and ask if there was any animal here that could make this sound, he said some sort of canine maybe . I said ""No Sure, it wasn't any kind of dog or coyote or fox or crane - ( which is what my husband said it could have been-but no it was no crane . I've heard cranes before and they do make a scary sound, but it wasn't a crane.) or any kind of cat , I've never heard anything make a sound like I had heard in real life before. ) He then ask "" what did it sound like?"" I hesitated for a second or two before I said "" A Bigfoot "" He said back to me ""well, like said it could be some sort of canine or something like that."" When he said that, I started crying - I couldn't help myself, I cried and told him that this was no joke that I was serious and that I was scared to death now . I believe he was thinking he had real nut case on the phone crying, telling him how scared she was cause she heard a BIGFOOT in the woods behind her house. I think he got a good laugh out of it anyway . Please believe me every word I've put down on this page is true . There is something in the woods behind my house that hollers, howls and I'm very scared of what it could be . I didn't see what it was and I pray to God that I never do, I did hear it and I also pray to God that I won't hear it again . But with God as my witness this is true . One more thing I would like to say that I have wondered about. I mentioned the tractor pull and I've wondered if maybe the sounds the tractors were making when they would start to pull -the winding up sound of the motors could have been the reason this thing was hollering-maybe it thought there was another one around calling to it but in fact it was the tractors, I don't know. I've thought about what everyone around where I live would be saying about me if they found out that I said I had heard bigfoot in the woods behind my house. If no evidence could be found to show that what I was saying was true, I would have big looney toon wrote across my back as long as I live here, I would be laughed at by everybody. Iv'e decided that I and only I know what I heard and I know how it's affected me -I feel like I've had a close encounter with evil - something I had heard might exist but I didn't really ever want find out if they did, especially from personal experience . I know that I and only I will have to deal with this feeling and that I don't really care what people here say as long as I know I'm telling the truth . If somehow someone did this as a hoax, (no way) they did a great job. I'd have to say that they're professionals. No way is this a hoax on my part. I've never been more serious about anything before as I am about this. Because I am so afraid here now, especially at night, I called the game warden back today and asked if could investigate this just to see if there might be evidence that this thing might have been or might still be in the woods here. He said that they hadn't had anyone else report anything like this but he would check it out. I don't know if he will or not. The answer to my prayers would be for him to investigate it, find it, catch it, and take as far away from my house as he could go. Now that I've wrote all this down and hopefully been able to convince you that this is not o hoax- I only hope that your sight is no hoax!",private residence on Huntsville Brownsferry Road,Tanner,Huntsville Brownsferry Road,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2300,NA,NA,waxing crescent,10,farm,NA,NA,NA,NA,114.30,375.0,125,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,howling,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,sounded as if a deer had been caught,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=15597

I immediately went down stairs and ask my friend if he was attempting to play a joke but he was already down at the boat in another direction.

BFRO,Alabama,Madison,416,Dave Sidoti,1983,November,15,Fall,A,animal,NA,"I was walking home from fishing, taking a different trail. As I got about 2/3rds. up the hill I had the hair on my neck stand up and a feeling like I was being watched. This was around 5:00pm. I just casually kept walking till I got home always checking my back. It happened again within a week. Maybe a few days. Did not smell anything cause I had been fishing or no smell anyway. Wasn't long afterwards I was checking on the clouds of a thunderstorm when lightning struck close to the trailer. By this I mean I had my head out the door. I heard a yell about 70yds. behind the trailer. It didn't sound like a cow but I checked anyway. No cows had been in the area for at least 6 months. The scream was high pitched without coming down a lot at the end. With my wife being there, I just closed the door and didn't say nothing. I would say the following Sunday afternoon, my wife went to church at 6:00pm. and I stayed home to watch TV. About 45 min. later, I was laying on the couch watching TV, when something had blacked out my window at the far end of my trailer. The window was 1ft. wide and 3ft. tall. I had raised up to look out my picture window above the couch and it turned the corner and walked around the steps at the back door. It was looking off into the woods and as it kept walking, it looked at the ground. Understand this though, I had clear plastic on my window to keep heat in from winter.(Hadn't taken it down yet.) When it got to the window, I had already laid back down on the couch, looking up and lay still. It looked down at me and kept walking, hopefully. I laid there for about as long as I could stand maybe a minute. Then I got off the couch by sliding on the floor, went and got my gun walked back in the living room and waited a minute, then went outside making all noise I could. I checked the back of the trailer, nothing there. Details of Bigfoot is as follows, he was about 7ft. tall maybe 7ft.3"". Solid black, no white or brown that I could see. Remember the plastic. His head was more rounded and not cone shaped. I could not see the color of his eyes or anything like that. He was broad shouldered and thinner around the waist than what you usually see in the pictures and he walked more upright, not humped over like a gorilla. His hands hung around his thighs. The next morning around 10:00am., I got up from bed as I worked 2rd. shift then. My wife told me a friend of mine had come down to see me. I asked what did he want. She said she only saw him as the top of his head went across the kitchen window. We had to set the trailer on 4 blocks high and 3 on the other end, which meant you could not see anyone walking in front of the trailer, not out the kitchen window anyway. I told her my friend was 6'4"" and with a hat on you could not see him the way she had told me. We lived on rocky ground but I had one dusty dirt spot at the end of the trailer. Hoping he had walked in it. I checked and in the middle was a footprint. It was about 12 and a half inches long and 3 and half to 4 inches wide at the heel. Being dust it was only 1/4"" deep. There were only 3 toes which I did not understand at the time. I told some friends at work and one came to see it. The following Friday or Saturday night, he and a friend of his came over, no drinking sorry. And I told them the whole story. My friend was not hard to convince but his friend started talking big. So I told them let's go outside. Joking around to see how brave he was when we heard two dogs about medium to small size started barking and chasing something on the other ridge behind my trailer. Which was not far at all, maybe 200yds. They chased it into the small valley about 50yds. south of us. When one dog quit barking, the other gave one more then it was quiet. Stunned, we looked at each other and Bigfoot started running back towards us. It stopped about 80yds. from us and started to hit a tree with something that sounded like a branch about 4 to 5 inches thick. Then it ran closer to about 40yds. and done the same thing again. By this time all bravery was gone. I went back in the trailer and got my gun. Come back out and asked if anything had happened.

BFRO,Alabama,Madison,25559,Joanna Cuva,2009,February,24,Winter,A,animal,NA,"I was staying at the Marriott hotel 6th floor in Huntsville Alabama at the Space and Rocket Center-At 5:40am on Feb 24th 2009 I went on the balcony to drink my coffee as the room was too stuffy and hot. I was out there just thinking and staring off at the woods when something caught my eye--after refocusing on it I realized there were legs, then arms, then I could clearly make out his face. The creature stood 6-7ft tall and was staring directly back at me-it seemed to have fine hairs all over -grey color hair that got more black as the hair got closer to the skin--the tips of the hair were much lighter--the face (lips, eye lids, etc) were more of a very dark brown-it stood very erect, was very muscular, and did not seem to have the apelike protruding mouth and nose but more flat faced human like--after 30 seconds he started rocking back and forth--I then realized this was moving and could in no way be mistaken for a dear or bear or anything else--this was a fully erect apelike animal that seemed to want me see him --he was rocking back and forth from side to side. After the initial 30 seconds he rocked for about 10-12 seconds then stood and stared at me --I was on the 6th floor about 120 yards away in decent lighting due to hotel lights and street light behind loading area of hotel-he then would stare back then he would remain face forward with feet only about 2 feet apart would lean over to his left with his right arm would start pulling bark off a very large pine tree--it looked as if someone were in a sawing position--then he would stand up stare at me then rock and then pull bark--this was done in that order 3 times over a 5-6 minute period--after five minutes of re-verifying what I was looking at I felt this creature was docile and smooth moving--I decided I would try and get a closer look--as I opened the sliding glass door he stared and I stared back--I ran out of the hotel room and there was security in our hall laying the morning news at the hotel room doors--I asked him to come with me and asked for back up since he had no gun--we ran around the corner outside - as we were running I Finally got the nerves to tell them what I saw--we get to the reference points I had chosen and there were a lot of fresh bark removed from the large pine tree--I tried to pull bark from it to no avail -- it was too hard--I am 6'4"" 300 lbs. I went back after 7am (light) -- I did notice what looked like scat --it took the form of explosive diarrhea and looked like a hundred birds had pooped in a small area--like in a shotgun pattern-heavy in the middle and lighter to the outside perimeter-I put a large handful in a Marriott laundry plastic bag--It looks like feces and digested berries and seeds. (It was dry although it had rained the night before) One of the Marriott employee's saw two large footprints --more like deep indention's in the pine straw--I took off my shoe and placed my foot in it and there was about a one inch area all the way around my foot in order to fill the indention--Something very heavy had to make these indention's--I tried and I am 300lbs and could not.

BFRO,Alabama,Marshall,18043,NA,1992,NA,NA,Summer,A,animal,NA,"a long story here. it is now march 3, 2007. i live in guntersville alabama. i have spoke to some of the employees just as conversation. the story is this. about 15yrs ago, my wife, and two children were leaving our home in honeycomb, just north of guntersville off of hwy. 431 at the bottom of grant alabama. we were in route to wal-mart. about 8-9pm probably mid summer. a well lit seems full moon night. we lived 4mi. around past the lake in honeycomb. i was driving my old hot-rod a 1964 ford. there are some persons by the last name of (name removed by investigator) who always have dogs in the street at their house by the lake. the road white elephant rd. run by the waters edge in front of their home. the road is about 4ft off of the shore line. the (name removed by investigator) s had two st. bernard dogs along with their other dogs. that particular night driving past i saw in the water walking away from the road and shore a large 8'sasquache. i looked back in my rearview mirror, and still turned around to look thru my back glass. my wife saw my dismay, and quickly ask what’s wrong, she at that time looked back, i always drive slow by their house as the dogs are always in the road, so she had time to look, all she saw was the ripples in the water, as we passed a few trees. it was a full moon night, and no wind-calm waters. now what i saw was the 8' sasquatch carrying one of the st. bernard heads. i in the time that drove by slowly saw the bigfoot from the knees up, carrying the head of the dog, some flesh was hanging from the neck area. the head was in the bigfoot's left hand. he was carrying it from the dog hair at the top of the dog head. i said to my wife at that time that if one of those dogs came up missing that the sasquatch was the reason why. however both dogs came up missing and we never saw them again after that time. now story up to date. telling the story to many persons in the years passing, as people tell stories, i finally told the guys at the tva where i work as a contractor for the government. my relationship with mr. (name removed by investigator) is just knowing each other from the window of our vehicle as we would wave to one another, as our children road the school buss with each other. i finally one day about 4yrs ago asked him what happened to his dogs, and told him the story of what i saw. he said one of the dogs died in huntsville alabama at his mothers home, and the other died at his home in honeycomb and he buried it behind his house. now. i didn't push the issue of letting me dig up the dog's corps as it would be kind of tacky. but if you guys want to contact me and send some investigators to check and see if mr. (name removed by investigator) would allow you to dig up the corps to see if its head is missing, you may get some clues or even some hair form the sasquatch. however if the head is still attached, then i was hallucinating the whole thing, and my wife would just imagined the water ripples too. i don’t do drugs, or smoke dope, and didn't at that time either. the only thing running thru my veins is good wholesome native american blood. i would love to participate in pursuing this investigation if there will be one.",a mile up White Elephant Road,Grant,White Elephant Road,NA,34.463996,-86.298382,181.789,597,2030,NA,clear,full moon,100,"lake , forest",NA,NA,NA,NA,45.72,150.0,50,NA,1,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,dark,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,long hair,NA,"carrying dog head in left hand by the hair , road crossing",NA,road crossing,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,powerline cut nearby,1,"I spoke with the witness who recounted his experience as described in the report. The witness saw the animal from about 150 feet as it was walking into the lake. His view was from the animal’s left side. The witness described it as having long hair and described the hair color as being “dark” as he couldn’t discern the animal’s hair color. The witness estimated the creature’s height as being about 7 to 8 feet tall. The witness could clearly see the St. Bernard’s head being carried in the creature’s left hand. The St. Bernard’s head was being carried by the hair on top of its head, snout forward, and flesh could be seen hanging from the dog’s neck. The witness later spoke with the owner of the St. Bernard to inquire about why the dog hadn’t been seen in awhile. The owner of the dog said that the dog had died a couple of days previous and had been buried back in the woods behind his property. It is hypothesized that the buried St. Bernard was located by the creature, dug up, and head removed. The witness has suggested digging up the remains of the St. Bernard in order to confirm what he thinks he saw that night. Current forensic studies suggest that after 15 years, there would be very little left of the St. Bernard due to the natural process of decay as well as the scavenging of animals. The witness, who is very credible, has presented a case that offers the possibility of what appears to be very interesting sasquatch behavior. Editor's note (MM): This location is near a power line route. Sightings and related incidents often occur within a short distance of power line routes. This is true in both eastern and western states. Deer and elk often move and feed under power line routes. The trees and tall brush are cut away in these swaths, allowing berry bushes and grasses to flourish there. There is almost always a gravelled access road under power lines, but very little vehicle traffic throughout the year.",yes,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=18043

We left Interstate 10 travelling north towards the Dawes community where my mother grew up and most of our family still reside. We crossed the smaller of two bridges in close proximity to one another when we saw what we first thought must be a VERY large dog sitting in the opposite lane of the road. As we approached we saw the creature was sitting on haunches as a dog would but was face to face with us in the car ( an 80's model pontiac parisienne). It showed no fear and did not so much as budge as we passed it, it did turn it's head and watch us as we drove by. Unlike a dog the creature had a human like face that was the only part of its body not covered in long reddish brown hair. Even seated on its haunches the creature was about the height of an average man. It was more slender in build than the average ""Bigfoot"" we have seen portrayed in reports of sightings in the northern part of the US. We don't want to say this was a bigfoot but after watching a special on the history channel my mother and I agree that the similarities are enough to contact you and see what you think.

At approx. 0100-0200 I was was voluntold to get our bags out of the car since we hadn't brought them in. The car was about 30 ft from the bottom of the ramp on the back porch and 20 ft from the north end of the car port (which is mostly open, except for a single partially closed in section on the north end). The night was dead silent with no wind. Upon reaching the bottom of the ramp I began to turn to my right towards the car when I heard what can only be described as similar to a bull snorting mixed with a grunt. I immediately turned towards the location of the sound, the back of the carport, and drew my sidearm. Due to a light on in the carport being pointed directly at me, I could not see what it was, but a shape. I had a small flashlight on me and pointed it at the thing. It didn't help much due to the light being in my eyes, but I was able to make out a creature bigger than me and at least 3 ft across at the shoulder. It made the sound again, but didn't move. I called out to it, thinking it was a person, but no response. After what felt like a few minutes, it made the sound again and seemed to get shorter. I began to move to my right towards the car to retrieve a rifle I kept in there and the thing moved to my left, so that we effectively circled each other until it reached the end of the carport on the south end. I reached the car and without turning, retrieved my rifle. As i pulled it out, the creature turned towards the woodline at the back of the property and seemed to either slowly run or quickly walk into the brush. i took this time to go back into the house and get a better flashlight. I came back out maybe 5 minutes later after finding one, to find nothing. The guard dog had reappeared and you could hear various insects around. The next morning I went to the area at the back of the property where the sighting had happened. From looking at disturbed spots on the ground I could tell that whatever it was, it had padded feet with a step of about 3-4ft., was between 7-9ft. tall, and moved in an upright fashion on two legs. Since then it hasn't been seen again, but there are times when the guard dog mysteriously disappears and there is no sound outside. the whole incident lasted 10 mts. or so. To add, the dog is called a ""guard dog"" because if anything happens, he will be the first to leave. i.e, if he's there, nothing else is. Don't see the dog, you have a problem.

I woke up to use the bathroom at about 4:00AM and had just laid back down when I began to hear loud vocalizations. The sounds where very similar to the Ohio and Mississippi recordings. I was inside the house and his heating unit was running so they must have been very loud outside. I got up and went out on his back deck but by the time I got there they had stopped. I listened for about 10 minutes and heard nothing. The heating unit was next to the deck and was quite loud so I decided to go back inside. About the time I started to fall asleep it started again the howls lasted about 3 minutes. Then stopped I thought that it might be my friend snoring in the back bedroom but I don't believe this was so because the neighborhood dogs where barking throughout the area in response to the howls. At this point I knew something outside was making the noise. I wanted to go into the woods for a better listen, but walking into the woods with no one in the know and not prepared for self defense or to photograph or record the creature did not seem like a wise proposition.

He was very alarmed, frozen in fear he managed to move forward a bit and the creature seemed to move around the tree as he moved like it did not want to be seen. He saw no facial features due to the brush. It suddenly moved away from him in the opposite direction and disappeared. Again the movement he saw was 7-8 feet off the ground always while in sight of the creature. He could hear the creature moving through the brush but the movement was not as loud as the witness thought it should be due to the creature's large size.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=25112
BFRO,Alabama,Morgan,39383,Michael Brumfield,2012,August,NA,Summer,A,animal,NA,My sighting happened last summer. I was kayaking down a creek. It was about the middle of the day. I was comin down the creek. The creek I was coming down is deep in some parts and shallow in some. There are always deer and turkey moving through. When I came around the curve in the creek a splash happened right in front of me. I thought it may have been a fish. So I kept paddling. Then three more splashes hit by me. The last splash I saw it was a rock. So I slowed down in the creek to look. I started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees like a person would. Then it stood up. When it stood up. The hair on back of my neck did. Me and it made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It turned and started running through the woods. I've seen and heard people run through the woods. Its stride was wider than any humans. When it ran it didn't bother dogging sticks and stuff. It just ran through the brush. After that I turned around and started paddling back to my truck. I went back down there that night to see if I could spot light it. I done a howl and waited to see if it would respond. But than I heard two knocks back to back. I knocked on a tree. It knocked back at me. But it was off in the distance.

Then three more splashes close by. The last appeared to be a rock. Slowing down he started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees much like a person. Upon standing up the creature and witness made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It appeared to be about 7ft tall and weighed around 400 + pounds. It had a shoulder width of about 3 1/2 ft. wide. The hair was a mix of black and gray along the lines of a raccoon. The hair length was approximately 4-5 inches in length; it was matted with mud up to the knees. It had an odor of fish and mildew. The head was conical, with an almost flat nose. The right hand that was wrapping around the tree as the creature was playing peek-a-boo was black. It appeared to be very stocky with little to no neck. After it was done watching the kayaker it turned and started running west through the woods. The witness stated that he is an avid coon hunter and has heard people walk through the woods. This did not bother to go around brush, it just went through it. After the encounter the young man had enough and paddled back to his truck. He returned that night to see if he could “spotlight” it. After a while he thought he would try a howl, no response, at first. Then two wood knocks were heard. He knocked back and received a knock back from the distance. But nothing was seen.

I played in the woods South of the Park and swam in the creek nearly every day.One afternoon just before dark I had been down near the creek at a small pond.This was before the City built sewer lagoon on that property. At that time there was a twenty or so acre sage brush patch there where they had not cultivated for years.That afternoon while walking from the lake back across the west end of that field I saw something walking a path along the eastern end.At first I thought it to be a huge man. That five foot tall sage brush was strikeing hin about the waste.It was in plaine sight for about fifty yards and turned and went back into the woods. It must have been 8 ft. tall and walked with it's head slightly bent forward, very dark in color. I could tell it was the same color from waste to the top of it's head.The longer I looked I knew it wasn't human.I ran home and told my parents but I don't think they believed me.I never went in those woods alone again until I was much older.When a friend sent me your site on the net and I saw Aliceville on it I had to tell my story",Eastern pike of East Lagoon,Aliceville,City Park,City Park,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,clear,NA,NA,"Lubbub Creek , forest","pine trees , oak trees , cypress trees , hickory trees",NA,NA,10,45.72,150.0,50,NA,1,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,dark,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,stooped,NA,NA,NA,walking down a path in the woods,NA,stooped forward walk,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"Witness observed the creature for about 10 minutes, at a distance of about 50 yards.

BFRO,Alabama,Pike,16473,Kevin Smykal,1994,April,NA,Spring,B,activity,NA,"I had noted on my Limestone, Alabama Spring 1978 sighting report that I would eventually submit other sightings that involved myself, others I know or did know or had learned from talking with others. I did not know it would be this long to submit them, but I have since married, had a child, lived in three different locations, had five different jobs among other things since I last submitted that Limestone, Alabama sighting. This sighting/encounter below involved myself, and two freinds, it unexpectdly and without intent being my second. The event I relate here happened to me and two friends in April of 1994 while I was attending Troy State University, Troy. I was undertaking graduate studies at the time. I lived in a campus dorm and had become friends with several people in the dorm and about campus. One of these friends stayed in a room a few doors down. He dated a young woman that stayed in the International House across campus. I had been studying on that paticular night I write of and had become bored with it. My friend knocked on the door and came in. I for the most part had an ""open door policy"". The door may be open, but knock before you enter so I'll know you are there. As Kevin and I talked we agreed to go pick up his girlfriend, Donna and go to ""Lookout Mountain"". I had been out to the place once before during the day about a month earlier so I offered to drive. We left campus around 11 pm or so. We headed up Hyw. 231 north. About 8 miles from the Campus we turned west/northwest (left) onto Co. Rd. 17 As we got closer to the so-called Lookout Mountian we noticed fewer and fewer houses. After about 15 minutes of driving we had found it and proceeded to park just off the road. We got out of my vehicle and then walked up to the top of this large hill. The hill is about 100 feet high from what I remember. It is supposedly the highest point in Pike County. The place seemed to be a well known and well used spot with open areas about the path to the top, besides one could see for several miles to the west, south and east from atop this hill. I recall seeing the rotating beacon that night at the Troy Airport several miles to the south. I knew we were not the first people to walk to the top and hang out nor were we going to be the last. Everything seemed cool. After about 15 to 20 minutes we three decided to head downhill toward the car and find something else to get into. I think we had decided we were going to go to Subway for a late night snack. Now here is where it got weird. Just after we started downhill I began getting a funny feeling and the hairs started to rise on the back of my neck, like something was there and we were being watched. Seeing how we were out at night in the country plus having a lady with us, Kevin and I had decided not to be foolish. We had both brought along weapons. I had a Colt .38 stuffed in the back of my pants in its holster and a few extra rounds in my pocket plus a good sharp replica Samurai sword. (Yes, a sword). My friend had a Glock 9mm and an extra magazine of rounds. My friend was in the National Guard at the time. I pulled out the .38 before we got even midway downhill. I had looked over to where Kevin and Donna were to my right. He had already taken out his 9mm so I knew he also sensed something by then as well. It was also about this time that we started hearing rather heavy footsteps. As we moved along I notcied the steps were on both sides of us. By the time we had arrived midway downhill we were aware that there were five maybe six...somebodys or somethings out not far from us. I recall that there were two and I'm pretty sure a third distinct grouping of footfalls to my left and two off to my right. Kevin was closest to the ones on my right so I'm sure he had heard them much better. Also by this time our Donna had become almost hysterical. I'm sure her few screams did not help matters much. Kevin said that it might be some other people messing with us like Frat boys. We stopped breifly. He shouted a few warnings that whomever was there had better leave us alone or speak up, he was ready to open fire. No answers. Nothing. I remained quiet, listening. Now any person in their right mind (perhaps even in a drunken state of mind) would have said something in order to keep from being shot at, I would think, yet there were no answers, no response of any sort. Just slience. We then continued to move downhill toward my vehicle but whatever they were kept back a bit and out of our sight and also to our sides yet they kept moving down along with us, not trying to hide their footfalls. As we approached the bottom of the hill we ran for it, got into the my car as fast as we could, cranked it up quickly, backed up, and took off back the way we had came. I am not sure if whatever they were moved out into the dirt road behind us or not as we drove off. I looked back but, it was really too dark to tell. Aside from that the road was narrow and had trees along each side of it and I was being as careful as I possibly could so as not to run off this road. I don't recommend under such cirmstances trying to drive out of such a place and look back at the same time. It took several minutes after we got back onto Hwy. 231 for Donna to calm down. I was shaken up but not too bad. I suppose the driving had something to do with it. I'm not sure how Kevin felt. I assume that his military training had taken over for a time back on that hill. We never saw what they were. Except for the footsteps they were otherwise quiet. At first I was not sure what they may have been however after considering the strange activites I felt they could very well have been bigfoots. I still feel that is what they were though I can never be 100% sure. Even so, what they did while we were on Lookout Mountain would seem much like reported and researched bigfoot behavior. After a few months and leaving Grad school I eventually lost contact with those two friends. I've not been back to Lookout Mountain since even though I have traveled up and down that part of 231 near there many times. I'm sure with a little driving about those dirt roads off Co. Rd. 17 I can find that hill again. I'm just not too sure I'd want to find it once again at night.",Lookout Mountain,Troy,Co.

My girlfriend's father was sitting on the hood of the car with his fishing pole in front of him. He was night cat-fishing. While we sat there, with the car lights shining across the river, my girlfriend and I were sitting in the front seat just making small-talk (honest), when all of a sudden I heard the most horribly incredible scream coming from my right side. To set the scene: Our car was parked about two feet from the water, on the bank. Off to my right about 60 feet was where the foliage began. Very swampy, very thick, and very hard to walk through. About 40 feet further up the bank (which can't be seen from our car because of the foliage) is a huge oak tree. I'd have to guess that the tree had about a 15 foot circumference - massive! About 10 feet up the tree is a huge branch that went about 20 feet out over the river. My friends and I would climb the tree and jump/dive into the river at least once every couple of weeks or so. During one occasion, there were about 9 of us standing on this branch attempting to make it move - we barely made it do anything, let alone shake! Anyway, back to the car. As I heard the scream, my body instantly went into what I think was shock.

(my feeble attempt to describe the sound of that huge branch I mentioned earlier that was shaking due to something GIGANTIC jumping off it into the water. The splash that came next was equally as horrific. All we did was just sit there in shock...waiting (I don't know why), staring at this point - straight ahead at the water. My guess is that we were waiting for the thing to float into our headlights. We waited and waited and waited and all of a sudden an object - black - long - I would guess at least 9-10 feet, floated into our headlights and stopped. Please keep in mind that this action was deliberate, because it was floating downstream.

BFRO,Alabama,St. Clair,8679,NA,1986,October,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"When I was around 11 years old, I had a strange encounter in the field behind my house. At that time, I believed I saw a crazy old man, but I now realize that is all I could rationalize it to be. I was walking alone at dusk with my dog. This was not unusual as I loved to be outside- my parents often had to force me inside by calling me in for the night. Well, from what I can remember of that particular night, I was picking up rocks in a ditch and looking at them. I might have been looking for a certain kind of rock but I can't remember exactly what I was doing. It was definitely getting dark, but I could still see well enough to keep after the rocks for awhile longer. I remember holding a stick I was using to pry rocks out of the dirt. It was very quiet and still and there wasn't much wind. As I was looking at the ground, I heard a noise in front of me and I looked up to see what it was, and that is when I saw him. He stood right in front of me at a distance of 5 to 10 feet, he was tall, but hunched and quietly staring right at me. He wasn't much taller than a normal man, but I got the impression he was old because he was hunching. He looked like Rip Van Winkle to me, and that is what I thought of when I saw him. He had a long shaggy beard around his facial area, but he was completely naked but for the long shaggy hair that was in matts all over his body. I remember the hair was thin at his face, the base of his neck, and upper torso, but thicker around his beard, lower torso and legs. All the hair was grayish white and very long and shaggy. Mats of hair dangled from him in tatters. His feet were bare. His face was very humanlike, but not quite normal as it had very exaggerated wrinkles- again, a reason I thought he was a crazy old man. His head seemed normal, but there was so much hair it was hard to make out his features except where the hair was thinner. He appeared gaunt and thin, but in just a moment I would realize he was not like an old man at all. I screamed as loud as I could out of fear and I noticed my dog bolted towards the house while I was taking in the sight of this strange thing in front of me. The shaggy old man let out a scream of his own when I screamed. He was staring right at me screaming in a voice that sounded like a woman shrieking- he seemed very scared of me as well. I turned to run for my house. I looked over my shoulder to see if he was following me and I saw him run up the ditch in the other direction. He was extremely agile and fast- he was definitely not Rip Van Winkle. He ran in a full sprint, very quickly for someone so hunched. I think I caught the dog running back to the house, as I was so frightened. I remember running into the kitchen and telling my Mom there was a crazy old Rip Van Winkle in the field. I remember describing how he was old looking, hunched, naked, and his hair was very long and matted like he hadn't cut it in 20 years. I told her about how he had hair all over his body. Needless to say, I wasn't believed. I became obsessed with what I called ""the Shaggy old man"" or ""the Crazy old man"". I believed that he must have been an old deformed hermit. I kept a notebook in which I drew many sketches of him. I remember keeping the notebook secret from my family, hiding it out of fear of being ridiculed. I wish I had those sketches now but sadly I've misplaced that notebook. I remember I went back to the spot in the field looking for him on other occasions, but I never ran into him again. I wasn't aware enough to look for prints or anything like that, but I knew that he was out there somewhere and I wanted to prove he really existed to others. What changed my opinion of this sighting was a late night visit to a bigfoot website. I was just browsing their sightings index and I came across several sightings in the same county I lived in and all described white or grayish colored creatures. Honestly, I didn't realize bigfoot were sighted in this part of the country at that time, or even for most of my life, and just seeing all those other sightings was a revelation. I realized for the first time that what I witnessed may not have been a crazy old shaggy man, but rather a bigfoot. When I think back on the sighting, it all makes sense in that light. There would be no reason for a naked old man to wander that field, much less to be covered in grayish, white, shaggy tattered hair. The only reason I never thought of it as a bigfoot before was that I had never heard of an Alabama bigfoot, so the thought never entered my mind. Also, I had never heard of a whitish gray colored bigfoot, and this creature was thinner than a typical bigfoot description- maybe he was older or maybe even younger. He looked a bit hungry to me, as he was not some hulking powerful creature, but he was still strong looking and extremely agile.","near Moody, AL",Moody,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1907,NA,clear,NA,NA,"field , forest , mountain","pine trees , oak trees",NA,NA,NA,2.74,9.0,3,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,grey white,6,grey,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,thin,stooped,NA,"exagerated wrinkles on face , matted hair , resembles ""Rip Van Winkle"" , hair culminated into beard",M,"staring at witness , retreated from witness after screaming , fleeing",yes,hunched posture,bipedal,high pitch scream after witness screamed at it,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"During a phone conversation with this observant, articulate witness, a few more details surfaced.

It was a thursday about mid july of last year (1999). We had gotten on the water about 6:30 and started fishing. We put in at Rocky Branch and went up river towards the upper end lock. Towards night fall we started fishing back toward the launch. about 11:30 we were fishing a secluded part of the shoreline. The nearest house was probably 2-3 miles down river. We were fishing close to the bank when I heard something walking at the top of the hill. I figured it was a deer and didn't pay it any more attention. As we proceeded down the bank the sound started down the hill towards us. There were two distinct foot steps instead of four like a deer. I thought I was hearing things so I looked back at my buddy and he was looking up the hill towards the sound. We decided to go look for another fishing spot (because we were getting a little spooked)and started putting everthing up to make our run. As we were doing that, whatever it was broke into a run towards us. Before we could get the boat cranked the creature let out the most herendous snarl and growl I had ever heardand then hit the water after us. We both love to hunt and spend alot of time outdoors but neither of us had ever heard anything like that, nor could we duplicate it when we would tell people of our encounter. I hadn't thought anything else about it until we got on this web site and heard the recording of the growl sound. That was the closest thing I have heard to the sound we heard that night. I'v read that usually there is a strong musty smell preceeding most encounters, but we didnt smell anything unusual. Perhaps this was due to the fact that we were in a cross wind with the creature. We don't know exactly what it was because we havent gotten up the nerve to go back and look around. That was probably the last time I have been on the lake.

He walked over to it and stated that he wondered what might have made such a large pile. As he looked around for horse or cow tracks, another person walked over to look at it and said ""Look at the size of these foot prints"". They all began looking around and found tracks coming out of a grassy area onto a dirt road. The tracks went about 20 feet then turned left into the freshly plowed field (plowed the day before). They proceded about 30 feet into the field. There you could tell where it paused to squat repositioning it's feet to do so and did it's business. While in this position it dug up some turtle eggs in front of it and ate them leaving broken shell behind. The feces were the consistancy of horse droppings in that they were of high fiber content and contained undigested muscadines(a kind of wild grape). But the droppings weren't in the shape of horse manure,(round ballshaped piles) but were long and cylindrical like that of a dog or human. The feces(2) were about 18-24 inches long and about 2 1/2-3 inches across. Rather large I must say. The tracks then turned left again into an area of tall grass, small pines and other small trees that lined a field at the edge of the woods. I wasn't able to follow them very far due to dead branchs, briars and undergrowth that blocked my progress. Plus I was wearing only sandals, shorts, and a tank top. Not prepared to trek through the woods. I took pictures of the tracks and the feces with a yardstick for size comparison. I also took a specimen of the feces and turtle egg shells which are still in my freezer. I have a cast of a left and right foot. The right one broke trying to pick it up but is still n pretty good shape. The left one is completely intact. They measure approx 18 inches long, 8 inches wide at the toes and 4 1/2 inches at the heels. The stride measured 3 feet from the toe of one foot to the heel of the next step. Each foot has 5 toes. A humanlike large toe on the inside of the step and each toe following being smaller than the last. There is an arch to both, showing it is not flatfooted. I took these samples to the Univesity of Alabama and showed them to a professor who is an anthropology professor in forensics. I walked away disappointed to hear him insist that what I had were Bear tracks. But he had been on a bear trip since I had spoken to him a few days prior about my find. When I arrived at his office, before he even looked at the cast he was talking bears and showing me books and pictures of bears and bear tracks. I tried to say Bears don't have a Big toe, but he tried to make up reasons that these tracks of a ""bear"" had a big toe. I realized this person was not going to believe what he was looking at was not a bear. It either frightened him to think it was a possible Bigfoot out there or he was embarassed to say he didn't know what it was. Just a ""Bear"". Well there is our encounter of a Track sighting.

They also showed me a shooting house (for deer hunting) which had been broken and overturned. They then showed me the photos and casts of the tracks, which were just as described in this report. I examined the casts carefully, looking for any sign that they could have been faked. I found no such indication. The size and shape of the tracks plus the step interval definitely DO NOT indicate bear. The witnesses first thought was that someone must be playing a practical joke on them, but the fecal evidence and the tracks just seemed too definitive to dismiss or explain away as a joke, especially considering the fifty-four inch step interval they measured. Photographs of the tracks and casts were also sent to experts within the BFRO for analysis. The witnesses did not insist that there was a real Sasquatch present at the property; they simply wanted help in determining whether the evidence was hoaxed or is genuine. I saw no indications that point in the direction of hoaxed evidence. Evidence collected by the witness was sent by the BFRO for scientific analysis, but the analysis proved inconclusive and does not contribute to our understanding of this event at this time.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=6938

My husband and I have heard screams in the woods from some kind of animal that is so loud and it has a long guttural yell that sounds like a man... We have never heard anything like this. This has been going on now for three weeks in March 2012, almost every night just about 8:30, or right before it getting dark. Then it stops for about a month, and now it has started back up again. I have lived in the country all my life and I am 52 and my husband is 66 years old. We are not a bunch of kids making these things up. I know what cougars, coyotes, bears and wolves all sound like. We have never heard anything like this in the woods before... Other then fourteen years ago, my son who is in the Army and still is to this day. He and I were sitting outside one night at 11:00 talking... We heard the same thing yell out then... It came from behind my house and it yells out in that long guttural yell three times and after the third time it sounded like there was 50 or more coyotes were surrounding us and they stated yapping like crazy. ... The recent sounds are coming between my Grandfather's old house place and my home... It is about a 1/2 mile away. We have a huge lake behind us and nothing but woods... My grandfather has some old abandoned gravel pits and lakes close by too.. There is a swamp in front of our home about 1/4 mile away. I was also told when I was a child that back in the 1930’s my grandfather went through the gravel pit one night ... He saw something setting on a hill that looked like a huge hairy thing that had a face like a man.... This was before all the media hype from the Patterson films.. I need help because this thing is getting closer to our home. My husband doesn't have good hearing and he said he could hear it upstairs one night and it sounded like it was in the yard. We have animals, Cattle and Donkeys here we don't know whether to shoot at the sounds from where it is coming from or what... On March 31, 2012, it sounded like it was right down at the bottom of the holler right past our fence ... It sounded like TWO of whatever this thing is, was mad and was yelling at us. I got so scared I took off running into the house.... I have never been so frightened in my life, and believe me when I say I go outside a lot at night by myself I really do, we have a huge wraparound porch I love to listen to the owls and whippoorwill at night but nothing like this has ever happen to me before.... Last week I went to put my puppy up for the night in our garage then I heard whatever this thing is, let out a scream, I called for my husband to come home it was back. When he got here we heard it growl. It came from the same area as before. Like I said before we heard it just about every night for 3 ½ weeks and then nothing… That night I told my husband HE BACK! Then the next night we heard it again but this time down in front our house down at the swamp.

I found their accounts to be consistent and believable. There were two sightings and the following can be added to the report: The first sighting was in 2011 at noon with the mom and son both witnessing the creature from their car. This route is driven by both witnesses daily. The hair was dark brown, long, shaggy and matted. The legs and hips were extremely thick and full of muscles. The height was estimated at seven feet and weight at 350 pounds with no fat noted. It crossed the road and into the woods in about three seconds. It moved very fast, running left to right on two legs. It used its hands and arms to shield its face as it sprinted into the thick undergrowth and branches. They were driving at 30 MPH when she hit the brakes. The biped was about 15 feet from the bumper by the time she stopped. The second sighting was in April of 2014 at 9 pm and happened within a few feet of the first sighting. The son was alone and driving home during the second sighting. The creature was dark in color and about the same size as the one seen in 2011 with a thick back noted. The creature dropped down low and ran away into the woods on the left side of the road when the high beams hit it. The two witnesses went to the location of the two sightings the following day, found and photographed some possible formations made from small, twisted branches and broken branches on the ground. We have reviewed the photos, not enough detail is seen to determine whether or not they were made with hands or if the branches broke and the sticks fell that way naturally. In August of 2014 at 2 am, the son's friend drove up to his house and a biped could be seen walking inside a wood line behind the house. It stepped behind a tree when the high beams were turned on. Eye-shine was then seen peeking out to the left then right side of the tree, back and forth for about 20 minutes before the eye-shine disappeared. The eyes were determined to be about 8 feet off the ground after inspecting the area with his friend the next day.

I was at home in my living room watching TV and my brother was outside working on a car. We were the only ones at home. The front door was located in the living room. We never used this door because we had no steps to it and the door was about 4 feet from the ground. So we used the back door of the house. I was sitting on the couch watching TV when the door began to move and the door knob was turning. The only thing holding the door shut was a nail someone had nailed at the top of the wall and bent it over to hold the door shut. I first thought it was my brother but he knew we didn't use the door. As the door was moving just a little I noticed at the bottom of the door where there was a gap, 3 fingers slide under the door. My heart began to beat faster, I tried to move but I couldn't at first. Then I wanted so bad to look out the window beside the door but I was too scared. These fingers were very long and the nails were long too and black. The hand like finger had hair on it dark brown. The hair was long. This only lasted for 3 min. When the fingers move out from the gap the door knob and the door stop moving. About 45 min. later my brother came inside and I asked him why he was trying to use the front door he said he hadn't. I didn't tell him what happened until sometime later.

BFRO,Alabama,Winston,30680,Matt Craig,2010,NA,NA,Summer,B,activity,NA,"I was canoeing on the Sipsey river in Alabama. It was dusk as I was pulling out of the river and I was trying to hurry to get all my gear in the car before it got dark as it was about a 60 yard walk up this steep hill to where my car was. Just as I was flipping the canoe up to put on my shoulders I heard this very loud ""WHOOOOP, WHOOOP, WHOOOP, WHOOOP"", then a pause then three more whoops. I 've been in the woods enough to know it was not an owl or like any sound I've EVER heard in the woods or on a river. Too loud, too powerful. It felt like it came frome about a quarter to a half mile away. It scared the piss out of me. You've never seen a guy hustle a 75 lbs canoe on their shoulders and practically run up the hill. I didn't even tie it on properly until I got up to the highway. The weird part was I had been watching the Monster Quest series and the month before had come down the same river and thought ""This area looks just like that crap they show in the Pacific Northwest where those bogfoots are. Wonder if there were ever any bigfoots in Alabama?"" So I did an internet search and it surprised the crap out of me and found a whole freakin website about Alabama Bigfoots. Those sounds I heard sounded just like the whoops you have on this web site. Of course after watching those shows it could have been somebody doing that call blasting thing but I had emailed the Alabama Research people and they said they did not have anyone working that area at that time(AUG 2010). Over the last year I have had a few ""unusual"" moments in this area. No sightings but well, I'm short on time.

He spends a great deal of time canoeing, fishing, and camping in the area. The initial report covered the majority of the details, but he did add that approximately 20 minutes before he landed his canoe, he let out a series of ""whoops"" just for fun. He is interested in the bigfoot phenomenon and uses his time in the outdoors to also look for evidence. We talked about the other unusual things that happened to him while in the area. One night, while he was camping in a primitive location, he woke at 4 AM to footsteps outside his tent. He was camping alone, and was in an area not easily accessible. On another occasion in the area, he was fishing at dusk and noticed the area had become eerily quiet. He did a few ""whoop"" calls and began to hear something in the brush behind him. Unable to see it, he threw a tangerine at the sound. He went back to fishing only to notice something hit the water near him. He thought it may have been something falling off a tree, until a second rock was thrown. He noticed that it was angled and had a trajectory. He left the area as quickly as possible. Mr. Johnson had also experienced extremely foul smells while in the area, but is unsure of the source. He said it could've been the wind picking up a dead animal smell.",yes,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=30680

The next notable occurrence was in their chicken coup. Two 2x4 cross members holding the chicken wires at the top, about 8 feet off the ground, were ripped down, and their two chickens were on the ground with their necks broken. Also, many of their caged quail located in the same barn have disappeared over time at night from an enclosure which requires hands to open. The cage is always shut the next morning. The second sighting occurred on November 2, 2013 around 4:45 PM, about one hour before sunset. Mrs. X was closing the back doors of their barn when she thought she saw movement in the woods downhill in her peripheral vision. As she was shutting the second half of the doors, she caught sight of movement again. She looked up straight at a creature, estimated between 7.5 and 8 feet tall, which froze staring back at her from 110 feet away. It was facing her. She estimated the weight at 450 lbs. The shoulder width was estimated at 3 feet. It had dark brown hair, with an orange tint, covering its entire head and body from 2-4 inches long. The face was completely covered with short hair of the same color. The legs were slightly apart. The feet were out of sight because of the curvature of the downhill slope. The arms were hanging straight down with human like hands. The creature quickly turned to its left and bounded diagonally away down the steep hill with long, straight-legged hops similar to what a deer might do. The arms were swinging right foot and right hand forward, left foot and left hand forward. The stride was 6-7 feet from the measurements Mr. X took in the leaf litter. The sounds went out of sight, over a 4-foot fence, and on down the very steep hillside out of hearing range. This sketch below depicts approximately what the witness saw before the creature fled. With both sightings, the wife said the creature behaved as if it was more afraid of her than she was of it and that she believes it was the same creature. On 12/4/13, Mrs. X was checking the greens in the garden next to the house, which rests between the two previous sighting locations. She found three fresh bare foot prints 9 inches long and 5 inches wide. There were 2 lefts and 1 right. Here is the best photo: Dermal ridges were present on one of the casts. A set of small deer tracks were also present. The track casting took place at night, just as rain moved in. A rock was thrown and landed less than ten feet from the couple and the print being cast at the time. There was also banging on the back side of the barn while casting (where the second sighting took place). Afterwards, it was noted that the newly installed, tight chicken coup wire had been stretched in a spherical shape about 18” off the ground.

BFRO,Arkansas,Baxter,1636,NA,1972,NA,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"I was standing about 10 feet down in the forest around a deep ravine not really too far from the house but it was right next to a patch of woods going back further south into the national forest. (The narrow patch of woods then stretched on northward.) Leaves were on the ground. That was the first thing that impinged on my consciousness -- the sound of something walking through leaves. It was a measured long tread, I could tell. I started really looking around trying to see what was making those sounds. (I was much braver back then.) Then over on the other side of the ravine close to the bottom but definitely walking uphill, I saw it. For all of about three seconds, seemed like longer at the time, and about 50-100 yards away. It was very large and I could see that it was hairy. I could see the ground between it's moving legs, and some vague image of arms, but not the head. Some forest branch obscured my view of the very top part of the body. I could tell it was walking upright uphill. It wasn't a bear; it was striding with a purpose up the hill on the other side. It was quickly out of sight. Now I know I wasn't thinking clearly, because I decided I had to try to get a better look at it. So I ran as quickly as I could around the rim of the ravine, since it's origins began in our front yard (not the best playground I can tell you). Anyway, it didn't take me long to reach the other side and move down into the woods slightly to look around and see if I could find it again. I did not see it again. I was there for only a minute or so when it suddenly occurred to me that I didn't hear anything anymore at all, no sound, no birds, no nothing, and fear like I'd never known before hit me and I went running practically screaming back to the house for mother. I told her what I'd seen and she, of course, did not believe me, though she told me to never tell anyone else the story. For a long time I didn't tell anyone, except family members, but they didn't believe. It didn't help that only one or two people since then truly believe that I saw a BigFoot. Since then I have lots of trouble going out alone in the woods. While no one actually calls you a liar, they look skeptical and you can tell they either think you'd been drinking/drugging or saw a bear.","10 miles south of Mountain Home, AR off Hwy 5 close to northern fringe of Ozark National Forest",Mountain Home,Hwy 5,Ozark National Forest,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"forest , ravine , pasture",deciduous trees,NA,NA,0.05,68.58,225.0,75,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"large , hairy",NA,walking up hill,NA,walking up hill with ease,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=1636
BFRO,Arkansas,Baxter,7969,NA,1980,June,NA,Summer,B,vocalization,NA,"When I was about 13 years old I went trout fishing with my mother and aunt on the White river in Arkansas. We were staying at a motel in BullShoals. One morning we drove to a remote area of the river to fish via an unkown dirt road. We stopped to fish a bend of the river. On the opposite side of the river(west), was a tall stone bluff with a slight over crop from erosion. On the east side was flatter land with 12 to 20 foot thin scrub trees about 20 to 30 feet from the water, as the river was low. While my mother and aunt where fishing off the bank, I decided to try my luck further up river, about 300 yards away and just out of sight with my mother. While I was fishing along the bank I began to hear rustling sounds in the trees and shrubs behind me. I looked in the direction of the noise and could see the tops of the these thin trees moving as if something were walking through them and pushing them to the side, but due to the thickness of the vegetation I could not see what was actually moving the trees. I stood and observed this activity for 2 or 3 minutes. I began hearing grunting type sounds that were very deep and substantial sounding. These sounds were similar but different than grunt sounds a bull would make. The movement of the trees began to appear as if something were shaking the trees at this point instead of moving through them. It appeared that whatever was making the noises was only about 10 feet inside the brush yet I could not see what it was. Feeling nervous, I decided I should return to my mothers side and began walking back towards my mother. As I did, whatever was in the brush moved with me step for step. As I walked the movement in the trees seemed more forceful with the sounds of large branches breaking as it moved. When I got within sight of my mother (about 50 yards), all activity stopped.

He had gone fishing on the White River with his mother and aunt in the morning (he estimates 10 AM as it was just starting to get really warm outside) in a remote area near Norfork . They weren’t having any luck and he wandered up the river around a bend and out of sight of his mother and aunt to see if he’d have better luck fishing. Soon afterwards he described hearing very deep grunts, snorts and heavy breathing sounds coming from some thick vegetation approximately 20 feet behind him. He said at the time he was 13 years old and the thought of a Bigfoot never crossed his mind. He thought it was probably a deer or a cow and didn’t feel overly concerned. He could see branches moving and shaking in the vegetation, but was never able to see what was there. He described the grunting sounds as “whoooooomp” and said they sounded very deep mixed with snort-type sounds and a heavy breathing as from a large animal. He listened and watched for a few minutes trying to see if he could make anything out in the vegetation and finally decided he should head back to where his mother and aunt were. As he was walking back whatever had been in the vegetation began following him at which point he started feeling nervous. He felt like he was being watched. He describes the area he was walking next to as very dense with very thick scrub brush with dense cane-like trees that were about 15 feet tall, 2 – 3 inches in diameter and very sparse with few branches. He said it sounded like it was very close and he should have been able to see it, but wasn’t able to. He could see the trees moving as whatever was paralleling him seemed to be pushing through the trees and said it looked like it was grabbing the trees and holding them aside as it pushed through. He continued to hear occasional “whooooomps” and grunts and stated it didn’t sound the way a hoofed animal would walk on four legs, but more like it had two legs and was loudly breaking and snapping branches as it walked. He stopped on two occasions trying to see what it was at which point whatever it was stopped as well. As he approached the area where his mother and aunt were and gained sight of them, the sounds stopped completely in an area where the thick scrub brush and trees came to an end near a clearing. He told his mother he was being followed by something and she seemed to shrug it off and they prepared to leave. He said he watched the area intently where the sounds had stopped at as they prepared to leave but never saw anything. He has been fishing in this area several times now that he’s an adult, but been unable to find the location where this occurred to him as a child.

They had caught their limit and were driving home. They drove across the Highway #101 bridge -due south across the lake and then west - to reach U.S. Highway #62. As they were nearing highway 62 and slowing for the stop sign at the intersection, they were startled to see in the beams of the vehicle's headlights a tall dark figure walking upright down the embankment on the west (passenger's side) of the road. It then made one long jumping step to the road's center line where it briefly paused, turned to look closely at the vehicle and passengers. Both men stated the animal then dropped with its knuckles on the ground, and ""swung his body through its arms and leaped several feet high into a pine thicket alongside the road where it disappeared from view."" In speaking with the witnesses by phone they both agreed the animal was over seven feet tall, with a very muscular body and covered in dark brown, shaggy hair. They assumed that it was a male but could not be certain that it was. Both men believe the animal was not a mature adult. When the animal disappeared, the driver turned to his friend and asked if he had seen what had happened. He replied that he had. Both men decided that they would not discuss the incident with others for a while. The submitting witness described the landscape as ""wood government lake strip."" To expand on his description, the investigator has added the following comment. The area is within the Ozark Mountains, and is about ten miles due south of the Missouri state line. The sighting occurred near Norfork Lake which is a U.S. Corps of Engineers lake which covers about 22,00 acres. The event occurred near one of the corps' fenced service areas. During our discussion of the event the men mentioned there was a ""Catfish Restaurant"" not far from the sighting location. The animal had come from that direction when seen, and disappeared from view down a hollow that entered the lake and formed Panther Bay. There have been numerous reports from this and other Arkansas lakes of enigmatic primates routinely checking containers near fish cleaning stations. During the Investigator's several discussions with the primary submitter of this report, he mentioned an unusual audible event which he heard along the lake near his home three years ago. He said that event was partially the reason for him submitting this primary encounter which occurred thirteen years earlier. He said that he was fishing off the bank of the lake near his home late at night. It was calm and cold. Directly across the lake was a ridge that formed a peninsula. He suddenly heard a large pack of coyotes high on the ridge excitedly vocalizing and moving down toward the lake. When the canines were about halfway down the ridge, they became silent. Immediately, from a location on the ridge closer to the lake, he heard two or three loud and quick noises like a hollow tree being struck by a heavy object followed by loud whooping sounds. At once the coyotes began frantically vocalizing and moving back up the ridge. Within a few seconds, the tree beating and whooping sounds were repeated, although he could tell they came from much further up the ridge. The witness said the same sequence of sounds, continued for about two miles up the ridge at an incredible speed, with the knocking and whooping sounds getting closer to the coyotes constantly. Near the top of the ridge all the sounds stopped. The witness stated he recorded the sounds on a cell phone, and when he listened to it later he was able to hear other whooping sounds that he had been unable to hear as the event occurred. (He said that unfortunately the recording was accidentally erased from that phone.) After speaking with both witnesses it was evident that both were credible observers.",yes,yes,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=55376

Then he told me that he seen bigfoot before and he told me the whole story. At fist i didnt belive him, but a couple of years later he told me the same story when we got on the topic again. The story is that he was riding ATVs with his friends around or in ether lost bridge lake of bever lake and he was at the front of the group of 4-wheelers and they were going down this hill that led to a dirt road. Since he was in front of the group he went down first and got on the dirt road and stopped to wait for the rest of the group to come down. before they came down he lokked over across the dirt road on the other side of the hill on the tree line where the evevning sun was shining through the trees and seen the big foot walking.

He retold his encounter to me honestly and matter of factly. Mr. G stated he and some friends were riding 4-wheelers in the Posey Mountain area and being somewhat of a daredevil, he was the first to go down a hill in this region. He said while waiting for his friends to come down the hill he rode around at the bottom to kill time. While looking up the other side of the hill he noted an animal standing bipedally appearing to reach up into the branches of a tree. Mr. G is an avid hunter and stated, in his opinion, this was no bear. His distance from the animal was approximately 150 feet. He stated it surprised him and he rode back to where his friends were urging them to go look. He stated by the time he got back to the area the sighting took place the creature turned and strode upright back over the crest of the hill and out of sight. He stated it was covered in hair from head to toe. He said he did not get a good look at the facial features, however, he felt they were hairy as well. He said the creature was thinner than would be expected for an upright bear with longer legs. and a long gait as it walked out of sight. He stated it walked smoothly more in keeping with a human gait than that of an animal. He said the animal's height he thought was around 6 feet, but could have been as much as 8 feet. He was unsure of this detail. His friends saw nothing as they were behind him. He said that he does not believe in UFO's or ghosts, or even bigfoot until this encounter. He is a little reluctant to call what he saw a bigfoot but was confident it was no bear or anything else native to the area.

We all thought it was very strange that someone would be out there naked at that time of night. None of us thought it was a bear because we saw hands (also, I had seen bear in that part of Arkansas and this did not resemble a bear). We didn't stop or turn around because we were all a little freaked out. I later realised that this thing had been standing on a small slope. It must have been 7-8 feet tall.

He stated the hand was very large and that he remembers when the animal moved to cover its eyes, the hand was down below the knee area swinging upward to the face, covering it. He said he did not note whether there was a point on this animal's head because of the large hand obscuring the face. He could not say whether the hand had hair on the palm or whether it was dark skin, but was quite sure it was a hand and not a paw. This animal was brown in color with what appeared to be human like hair covering its body. When asked about the other occupants of the car he was sure they had all seen the animal because they originally thought it was a man on the side of the road miles from any town. They discussed how odd it was for someone to do that at that time of night all alone, however, in further discussion realized the ""man"" wasn't wearing any discernible clothes and was very large.

The creature was first seen emerging from the woods near ""a power line clearing"". This clearing was for telephone poles and not the large clear cuts for the big power towers. The clearing was 30 feet or so versus 150 feet or more for the big clear cuts. The three of them sat in stunned silence as they floated the current.

After about approximately ten seconds of this, we heard a low gutteral howl. This howl was much lower and longer than the coyotes. I said, ""did you hear that?"" and about that time this sound repeated two or three more times in succession. Two of the guys dismissed these as howls of a Husky breed of dog. One of these two owned a Husky in the past. However, this sound was much deeper than the sound I heard his dog or the coyotes make. It was almost exactly the same as the vocalizations I listened to on your website. It was not the screeching vocalizations. All the sounds appeared to be several hundred yards away. After that, no more sounds were heard. Neither the coyotes nor the other sound. I believe these were sounds from a Bigfoot. I did not tell of my suspitions, for I have only revealed my beliefs to the guy who owned the Husky. I felt as though the others may not believe me or make fun of the situation.

From those conversations, the following details can be added to his initial report: The witness was driving a minivan west at night at a speed near 70 mph on Highway 82. The motorist said that he was about three miles inside Chicot County, AR, after having crossed the Mississippi River bridge from Greenville, MS. His wife was sitting in the front passenger's seat and was looking at her cell phone in her lap. Their children were asleep in the rear seat. The driver stated that he suddenly saw in the beam of the van's headlights ""a tall, large, greyish-haired creature, standing on his legs, run across the highway"" about three hundred feet in front of his van. The figure was running from a sparsely wooded area on the right (north) side of the highway and crossed the highway quickly in three long steps. It disappeared in a sparsely wooded area south of the highway. He stated the figure was uniformly covered in greyish hair of unknown length. It appeared that its body was ""solid and heavy,"" and seemed to be between six and eight feet tall. He said the figure's height was a rough estimate because at all times the figure was ""hunched over"" with its head also leaning slightly down. The figure never turned it head to look toward the van. Based on statements from the witness and this writer's familiarity with this area, it is believed the motorist saw the figure cross Highway 72 at the Ditch Bayou bridge. Highway 82 closely follows along the south side of Lake Chicot for about ten miles. Ditch Bayou is connected to Lake Chicot, which is noted for its abundance of large catfish, crappie and bass. The figure seen was leaving the lake area.

BFRO,Arkansas,Clark,3519,NA,1984,Spril,NA,Spring,A,animal,NA,"In the spring of 1984, I had been working with for the (undisclosed) in Arkadelphia, AR. That particular day we had to paint some boundry line around an area near Biern, AR, just southwest of Gurdon, AR. It was in the afternoon and I had already finished ""brushing"" out the line for the others to paint the dots on the tree. I knew of an old black man that lived in a little shack not far from there. He ALWAYS had an old loggers helmet on, carried an ole filled 22, and only wore blue overalls and a white shirt. After I had finished, I made my way back to the truck which was on a road that was near the railroad tracks. These tracks went through the middle of Biern. As you pull into Biern from hwy 67, you cross these tracks and then turn right for approx. 2 miles. The road then T's and can go to the right to cross the tracks again. In 1984, the road only went about another 1\4 mile before turning back to the right back to 67. Our truck was parked on that last turn that goes back to hwy 67. I had made my way onto the tracks to wait for the others. I wasn't quite a 1\4 mile from where the road crosses over the tracks. The signs that let you know of the tracks are maybe 8 ft. high. When I noticed something on the tracks at that cross-over, I noticed that it ""appeared"" to be another foot taller. That could have been an optical illusion at that distance. I noticed that I could not see the silver hard hat that the old man always wore, or the white shirt, or the gun. This thing, what ever it might have been stopped on the trakcs and turned. But when it turned, it had to turn the whole upper torso as though it had a stiff neck. It was mostly dark in color, it did have some lighter spots on it. It appeared to take a step towards me when another logging companies truck gun it's motor and startled the creature. It seemed to notice this, turn and take two steps to get into the woods. If you have ever been down the tracks of the railroad, you know that it would be impossible for a normal man to make that kind of distance in only two steps. You have to take into consideration that I was only 18 at the time and still had a pretty vivid imagination. Even with the evidence I had at that time, I questioned what I might have really seen. It wasn't until later that I found out that there have been many sightings of some creature in that part of the woods. A buddy of mine told me that his grandmother lived in that area and had trouble from a two legged creature getting into her garbage at night. He said that there was only one time that the creature came up on her back porch and look into her window. She said that it looked somewhat like a monkey. She never admitted that she was scared because it never threatened her in any way. This story sort of validated mine. This is not the only time that I have seen a creature out int woods.

The witness also stated the experience unnerved him so, that when his coworkers returned he had locked himself in the pick-up and was crouched in the floor of the vehicle. There were no other witnesses to this occurrence. When asked about the friend's grandmother for possible correlation he stated she had passed away in the years since his sighting.

Although the creature was holding its arms out when he first spotted it, the creature lowered its arms and Mr. B could not get a good look at its hands. Mr. B didn’t see any teeth but commented that its mouth, or jaw, did not protrude, but that the mouth was 'large'. Mr. B stated that its nose was short and that its nostrils were ‘big’ and flared. He described the head as being shaped like an ‘ape’s head’ but more rounded off. And that its eyes did not glow, but looked large and dark. -After looking at each other in silence for approximately one minute the creature resumed its walk towards the left side of the road and disappeared into the adjacent woods. Mr. B describes its gait as being similar to a man except that its stride was longer. Its posture remained upright during the entire episode. -Mr. B was adamant that he never felt threatened by the creature, even though it was only 30 yards away from him. He also made comment that the area is very rural and that it was only a mile or so from the Saline River. -As stated in the report, Mr. B did go to the sight the next day to look for tracks. But it had rained several times since his sighting and he could not find anything usable. -I found Mr. B to be articulate, truthful and matter of fact. -In doing a Google search from the area and questioning Mr. B, this area is very remote from any nearby houses.

We drove to a spot that we had just found a few days before. We parked are truck up on top of a ridge and hiked down a draw that leads into a canyon. I started down to a sidehill above the draw while my dad and brother headed down the draw. After being seperate from each other for about 15 minutes I was up above the draw a ways, and I was standing there looking around the hillsides when I heard a kind of moaning howling sound which to me at that time sounded like a man yelling ""help""very slowly and weakly like they were hurt. So I started to head back down into the draw to make sure it wasnt someone needing help. About 30 seconds went by and I heard it again so I stopped to listen I heard it a little louder this time since I was farther down the draw. This time I had a very weird feeling go through me I felt uneasy and almost a scared sensation but I still thought it was someone yelling ""help"". I eventually met up whith my dad and brother and asked if they had heard that yelling sound they said yes and that it was very close to them which they thought sounded more like an angry moaning sound and then heard a pop about as loud as a 22 rifle but it wasnt a rifle. So we made are way down to the bottom of the draw where the sound had come from, we came to a barbed wire fence around which the ground all around had been torn up quit a bit and the top strand of wire had been broken in half; which we looked at and could tell it was a fresh break-- we couldnt find any tracks that we could identify. We figured it was a buck or bull that got its horns stuck in the wire and had made the sound that we heard we had never known of them making this sound but what else could it have been we figured. So we finished the day hunting.

BFRO,Oregon,Baker,36076,Geoff Robinson,2011,September,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"Phone reception was poor, and I was asked by Steve to run him up to the top switchback to make a phone call. It was sunset, I ran him up the fairly short distance to the highest switchback and turned off the ATV, walking a hundred yards or so to give him privacy. It started getting dark (it gets dark and cold that high up real fast) and I began meandering back to hopefully hurry him up. As I approached a cluster of trees right up against the switchback on the uphill side, there was the deepest growl I've ever heard - in a warning manner. At first I thought it was a cat, but it was much deeper in resonance. Thinking this would be a short trip, I left my rifle and shotgun at camp, and only had my 1911 sidearm on me, and I wasted no time in shucking it. I was fearful for Steve, as this thing was between me and Steve who was unaware of any threat, so I slid-walked toward Steve, both arms extended at ready-fire. I peered as closely as I could, but could see nothing due to the tree cluster and twilight. As I finally slid-walked past the cluster and was now between the previously unaware Steve, I chanced a quick look over my right shoulder to see if Steve had noted anything yet. He had, and had also shucked his pistol, with the phone in the other hand, clearly getting off. As my head was turning back toward the low growling in the tree cluster, halfway, I was stunned to see an absolutely massive, huge, very tall creature hurrying toward the tree cluster. It actually had to slide past me to get to the cluster, so it wasn't threatening me. It reached the cluster and I heard no further noise, steadily backing up. Had there been a cat in those trees, there surely would have been quite a ruckus, but things went silent. I recall very clearly being not stunned by its size, but how fast it was and how quickly it covered ground. I remember thinking, 'this thing could run down a deer.' From Steve's angle, he couldn't see it, but the thing had to run across some thirty yards of knee high (to me) growth, so I got a good look at this thing. I reached the ATV and said, ""we're leaving."" In retrospect, after replaying this a hundred times again and again, I feel that there was either a female or juvenile in the trees, and was surprised when I approached, and growled to warn me off. This is entirely speculative, but I feel confident that the huge adult was hustling over to the tree cluster to tell the other one to 'knock it off.' The .45ACP is a very effective anti-personnel round up close. However, when I saw the sheer mass, if this thing wanted me dead, as big and as fast as he was, he'd have had me. Steve found another location to make phone calls after that which was much closer to the camp. Two weeks later, he came fogging it back to camp running - as he heard loud thumping steps and turned to see one running away - up the mountain.

He was speaking from his home in the Southeast. He is a mature, lucid, and articulate man. His demeanor was calm, yet obviously disturbed by his encounter. He explained that this was the first time he had ever seen anything like this and that he was still in disbelief. While the incident had occurred at least a year prior, the witness described the vivid imagery that still plagued his memory. Having served as a career Special Forces soldier in the Viet Nam conflict with extensive decorations, the witness related that he was an avid tracker, hunter, and all-around outdoorsman. He said his military occupation was “manhunter,” but he had never seen such a creature. While the vocalizations at first gave him the impression he was dealing with a large cat, he described that once he saw the subject, it was at least 2.5 meters tall, having shoulders “twice as wide as any man,” and dark, muddy brown, almost black, longer hair with a “cream-colored” face. His military technical jargon and vernacular were present during our conversation. In retelling the encounter, he detailed how the creature at first “growled” which appeared to be from a distance in the tree cluster, but the vibratory sensation and sonic impact felt as if the animal were standing next to him. In the ensuing moments, he saw the creature come between him and his friend and he said panic began to set in, mainly because he felt his sidearm would have been useless had the creature decided to attack himself or his friend. The witness repeatedly emphasized the girth of the animal’s legs, and the rapidity of movement, as apparently the creature was also in some sort of panic mode. The witness mentioned that the lodging he had taken during his stay in the area was staffed by a couple who were very familiar with the presence of large upright bipedal animals in the location of his encounter. I subsequently visited and interviewed the couple. They explained that the witness stayed in their inn along with Steve, as well as several other miners for the duration of their mineral exploration. The couple told me of two other encounters as recently as July 2012 by miners who stayed in their inn. Then they took me to the location of the witnesses encounter, high in the surrounding hills. While we accessed the location of the encounter via ATV late in the afternoon, one of the innkeepers spotted a ""dark figure"" on the ridge across from the switchback, in a clearing on a rocky outcrop. We attempted to spot the figure again via binoculars and 9x scope without success. This location is steep, not accessible unless by the most robust of vehicles, and known for mysterious vocalizations and sightings. All details from the innkeepers correlated with the witnesses description of the events. Since the town has an extensive mining history, there is also associated lore describing ""monsters"" in the hills.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=36076

After setting up camp in a clearing, with the intention of staying a couple of days,they spent the day tearing up and down local trails on their dirt bikes. Around dusk, they decided to return to camp. While proceeding down a trail towards their camp they found their path blocked by a large log which had been moved across the trail. As they had sped up and down this particular trail many times during the preceding hours, they were certin that this log had been placed there in the late afternoon.Because of the log's size, they did not attempt to move it out of the trail, but with great difficulty, managed to get their dirt bikes around it. Upon returning to camp,they debated packing up and leaving, as a definite feeling of unease and vulnerability had come over them.But fortified with Budweiser and the knowledge that one of them was packing dad's 357,they decided to stay the night.

BFRO,Oregon,Benton,10928,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,2005,March,13,Spring,B,activity,wood knock,"While on a hike during this nice sunny day, I heard a low grumbling sound. My husband was leading me along the trail and he did not hear this sound. I stopped him and described the sound to him as a sort of ""wild boar"" type sound. It was VERY hard to describe. The sound was low, deep, like a vibrating growl or snort. We looked around and listened. When we didn't hear anything for quite a few minutes, we began walking again. Not more than 3 or 4 steps down the trail we hear a rustle noise and I quickly turned to see a rock or something rather large, dark and round fall to the ground with a large THUMP! The item had landed just where I was standing only a moment before. My husband heard this large item hit the ground and we stood stunned for a moment trying to figure out where it came from. I looked around the area and found a rock about the size of a baseball sitting where the item had hit the ground. My husband and I could NOT figure out where it had come from. Was a rock in the tree and it just now fell? Did something throw that rock at us? We were a bit jumpy but kept on down the trail. About 1/4 mile along the trail we hear a loud ""whomp, whomp"" like wood against wood sound ahead of us up on the hill. I asked my husband what that was and he decided it was probably just some people doing work on the trail. I didn't believe that's what it was. It sounded too heavy to be man made. Maybe machinery, but there was no motor sound and it was a Sunday evening. I doubt workers were on duty at this time and on this day. Just then we heard the sound move and we turned to hear the same wood on wood ""whomp"" noise behind us on the trail and still above us on the hill. My husband remarked, ""If that was bigfoot I don't know how he moved that quickly!"" I told him that we could rule out trail workers and that it was quite possible that it was TWO bigfoot communicating with each other. We joked about it, but we were both very shaken. We just could not come up with a more reasonable explanation for this sound. My husband describes this sound as a person hitting a tree quite hard with a large log. After yet another few minutes of looking around and hoping to see something, we walked along the trail without answers. After this we heard nothing more and came across several hikers on the last mile of the trail. Several hikers had dogs and we didn't hear any dogs going wild barking at anything unusual. My husband and I were going to stop some hikers to ask if they had heard anything, but we didn't want to look crazy or scare them away from the trail. Other than the rock being thrown at us we didn't feel as though we were in any kind of danger. When I got home I called my father who is quite familiar with forest animals and noises. He couldn't explain where the rock would have come from, but he believes that the wood on wood sound could possibly be deer or elk. I doubt that it was deer or elk just because the trail was so populated. They would have been spooked by the hikers and the dogs... besides, the ""whomp"" sound was SO heavy and SO loud that I can't imagine a deer making such a large sound. We didn't smell anything, we didn't see footprints...but I can't think of anything else that would explain these noises and the rock being thrown at us. I just really feel as though it could have been ""Bigfoot"".","McDonald-Sunn State Forest , west on 99 north of Corvallis near Peavy Arboretum",Corvallis,Hwy 99,McDonald-Dunn State Forest,NA,NA,NA,NA,1630,70.5,clear,waxing crescent,12,"forest , creeks",NA,NA,NA,NA,402.34,1320.0,440,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,rock throwing,NA,NA,NA,growl,yes,2 knocks then 1 knock reply,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"The deep growl preceding the events could not be attributed to any reasonable alternative animal in that forest.

The following is what my wife wrote in her blog last night. Here is the link, where you can find some pictures of the area we hiked http://tleraadventures.blogspot.com/ Here's what she wrote: We were disappointed to find it incredibly foggy, since it is the highest point on the coastal range, and we had our hearts set on a spectacular view. As it turned out, the fog made the dense forest section of our hike even more interesting and gorgeous. All of the plants and trees were damp and dripping from the condensation, and the clouds were swirling around us at times- absolutely breathtaking! It was very secluded, and simply serene. About half way through our hike, we heard a UAS (Unidentified Animal Sound). The best way I can describe it is to say that it was a short, deep, guttural whooping sound. Whatever it was, was clearly rather too close for our liking. We weren't really frightened, but we were unnerved enough to take safety precautions. I stopped taking pictures, and Travis & I insisted that the kids walk between us in a tight group for the remainder of the hike. The sound came and went, and at one point it became clear that there were at least two of whatever-they-were, because we realized that not all of the sounds were coming from the same direction. They were alternating, as if they were communicating.

BFRO,Oregon,Clackamas,652,NA,1974,June,NA,Summer,A,animal,NA,"About a week or two after summer vacation started between my eighth and ninth grade years, my brother and I walked down into the woods not too far from our house, on the outskirts of Sandy, Oregon. There was a trail that was used by kids in the area to get down into the woods and a little way off the trail, my brother and I had hauled a little wood and built a little platform about six feet up in the crook of a tree. That day, around noon, we were in that platform, shooting our BB gun at a tall stump that was just a little ways down hill from where we were. My brother turned around as I was preparing to fire and just as I was ready to shoot the BB gun, something with a human-like head passed right in front of the tall stump. The trees and brush obscured everything but the head, but I got a good look at it. It had brown fur over almost all of the head, but not dark brown, just a little darker than cinnamon color, a kind of flat nose and the hair/fur was not too long. It walked by and disappeared into the brush almost without making a sound (there was a very heavy bed of needles from the Douglas Fir all over), it happened so suddenly and so fast that I didn't have a chance to get scared. I called my brother's name and he turned in time to see some of the branches still swaying. We stood there and talked about it for a few minutes and then carefully went down to where it passed in front of me and figured that it had to have been about 7 1/2 feet tall. After this, I went to my former eighth grade science teacher who happened to live in the neighborhood (this was a town of about 1,200 at the time) and told him about it. He was very skeptical and gave me numerous things that he thought I'd seen. He obviously didn't believe I had seen a Sasquatch/Bigfoot. Later that same day, around dusk, my brother and I were sitting on the trail, not too far from the ""tree fort"" that I had seen it from earlier in the day, talking about it. Suddenly, I'm not sure what made him do it, but he looked over at the platform that we had built (about 20 to 30 yards away) and his face turned white as a ghost. I looked over there and saw a sillouette of a""man"" looking at us (head and shoulders) from behind our tree fort. Since it was dusk, we weren't able to make out any features, just the outline. Also, we both jumped up and ran the rest of the way home, scared half out of our wits. The second sighting we had that day, the creature didn't seem anything but curious about us, but it still scared us. Also, two years later, I was down in the woods at almost midnight (I'd left something down there the previous day) and heard footsteps coming towards me and a huffing noise, almost like a horse blowing.

We were on the outskirts of camp, maybe half mile from main camp, very close to the molalla river. I was about 60 feet from a muddy creek, kind of a swampy area.

I was dead center with 25 yards between me and each trail. I faced west into the wind at about dusk. There was usually a lot of deer in the area but on that evening it seemed very quiet. Just as it became too dark to see my aiming sights, I heard crunching foot steps coming from directly behind me. At the time I thought it might be a buck in rut. The animal seemed to be following my sent directly to where I was hidden in some blackberry bushes. A cover scent had been applied to my clothes and boots using pine needles that were blended with water. My clothes were soaked in the solution and dried -- very effective ... for deer anyway. This animal walked right up to the clearing behind me. I had plenty of time to turn around to situate myself for a clear shot. I raised my bow and it came into view 25 yards away and stopped.

I hope you don't take my report as bogus because of that. Let me explain my situation to you: I live, and have lived, on the Molalla river for most of my life and never thought twice about walking around at night or anywhere period. About 2 months ago, I was alone in my Grandmas house using the computer, when I decided to go home (my house is only about 50 yards away). As I was stepping outside the most hideous feeling of being alone and fear thumped my heart. I kept walking in terror, when all of the sudden about 30 feet off to my right, I heard a loud thumping sound crash out. From there on, being distorted by my act of running faster than I've ever moved before, I could swear I heard the distinctive two-legged footsteps veering toward me from off the trail between houses. I raced in my house, slammed the door, locked it and sat in the living room to calm down from my strange experience.The oddest feelings flushed through me then, and now. Now, before you dismiss my story as a frightened child running from noises, I'll have to tell you of the strange past our 45 acres of land at the end of the Dickey Prairie road has had: Around three years ago, when we had cattle and cows fenced on our property, I noticed casually how they would always stay together and go near the barns at night. Then one day we discovered two of them killed up in the woods by the drinking creek. The killings weren't average killings either. The cows didn't have a scratch on them, both had broken necks and their eyeballs sucked cleanly out. Since those experiences, I'm now scared to go hiking and travel at night. Yes, average signs of fear, but I have the weird feeling of being an 'Intruder'. Thank you for your time sincerely, Shawn Murray p.s.

One, about a year before this, when something frightened his younger brother while the two of them were hunting on their property.

In order to get into it, something had strewn the wood 15-25 ft. from the trailer and rolled back the tarp. Ripped open bags were found in a field on the property.

BFRO,Oregon,Clackamas,187,NA,2000,July,22,Summer,B,vocalization,NA`,"Before I go any further, I'd like to emphasize that I am not sure that I actually heard a bigfoot sound. I am mainly putting it on here because I have thought about it in depth (that's why the delay in reporting), and the only thing in my memory that has any resemblance at all to what I've heard is the past audio recordings of bigfoot (although what I heard had better audio!). I still wonder if this was a bigfoot, how or why it would have been near a town, but I have no other explanations. I was in Sandy, Oregon with my family during the weekend of July 21-23, 2000. We were staying at the Sandy Inn, which is just west of the main part of town. It was hard to sleep the night of the 21st; it was very humid and some thunderstorms did move through about midnight or so. I was up several times during the night; either to shut the window, open the window, turn on the air conditioning, etc. I got up once around 3 or so in the morning on the 22nd after the storms passed. I was sticking my head out of our 2nd story window, enjoying some cool air and kind of looking off into the woods toward the north. There was not a sound anywhere (that I could hear). No cars on the highway, nothing. Then I heard a very indescribable sound. I thought at first it was tires screeching but as the seconds passed I realized a car would have to be burning rubber for a long ways. Then as I kinda cleared my head, I thought it sounded like a man screaming, or better yet, wailing. But I've n ever heard a human do a sound like that either. It was not a moan or howling with an ""o"" sound, it was more like ""eye-eeee--ah-eye-eee"". Very high pitched. It won't do me much good to try to interpret the sound in letters. But the way the pitch of the sound went up and down so fast, I've never heard any animal or human do that, and I've heard quite a lot of animals. If a a human did what I heard, they'd bust their vocal chords. It went on for about 20 seconds-maybe a little longer, but not sure of that. It did seem to kind of trail off at one point then come back. I know it was long enough for me to get a good listen. It was not close by, either. The window faced toward the north, so it's possible that's where it came from but I can't be sure of that. It seemed like it was off in the distance somewhere. When it started, it was rather quiet, and ended trailing off in the same manner it started. Even though I was a bit groggy, it was wierd enough to wake me up and even scare me a bit. I didn't think too much of it at the time but the next morning I was thinking to myself, ""What was that?""

BFRO,Oregon,Clackamas,1986,Thom Powell,2001,March,18,Spring,B,footprint,NA,"Today, March 18, 2001, my brother and I were hiking near Table Rock Wilderness in Clackamas County, Oregon. Found footprints in the snow very much like a very large, bare, human foot. We wear size 12 and 13 boots and the prints were significantly bigger. Using a dollar bill as a size reference I took pictures with a digital camera. Using the dollar bill we measured a stride of 4 feet. Also the prints were deeper than ours or the other human prints in the area. I would like to submit the pictures for expert evaluation and will do so if an e-mail address is provided.","Table Rock Wildnerness , To find the prints go to Table Rock parking lot.

(The one photoed) The others were about the same overall size and shape and sat in the right sequence. It is hard to say how old they were. My brother said a week but I thought maybe the night before. It had been raining and the detail was being lost fast. We did not disturb the one we took detailed pictures of but we dug around a little in the others looking for hair but we did not find anything. There was nothing that I saw that indicated that the aminal might still be around. But then again there was nothing I could point to that would indicate that he was gone either. We looked to find where he had gotten on the path and where he had left it but could not find anything. It is possible that he came from the Table Rock trail itself and so did not leave deep tracks that could be seen. Hope this has been helpful. If you have any other questions I will try to answer. Let me know if you find anything else. And if I find anything else you will be the first to know."" Results of follow-up investigation: On 3/20/01 I visited the location of the track find on Table Rock Creek in the Mt. Hood Nation Forest southeast of Molalla, Oregon. Precisely as the witness described, I found widely spaced bare-foot prints that measured 14"" long and were spaced an average of 48"" apart (from heel of one foot to same spot on heel of the opposing foot). I measured strides of 112"" between heel impressions of the SAME foot in two places. I counted twenty four prints in all. The tracks were beside a trail in the snow that follows a road bed to the Table Rock trailhead. Auto traffic is cut off by collapse of the roadway but snowshoe prints and boot prints were evident all along the road. The path along the road bed leaves the parking area as bare earth but gradually turns to completely snow covered. Snow depth at the track location, which is about one mile from the parking area, is about 18"". Several factors raise suspicion about the tracks: The tracks are close to other human tracks. The foot length is 14"", which could be a human with size 14-15 feet. The most impressive aspect of the tracks is the long stride between steps. Still, I was able to duplicate the long stride with running leaps. I'm 6ft. tall. Though fakery cannot be ruled out, it is also possible that a hiker removed his shoes for whatever reason and ran in the snow in bare or stocking feet for some twenty-four steps. The footprints looked to be made from bare, not stocking feet. Toe detail on some prints seemed to be too clear for stocking feet. On the other hand, the location is remote, the snow is deep, the elevation is high, and it therefore seems much less likely that a very large, barefoot person would be running through deep snow to leave these impressions for us to find. If the same tracks were found nearer to frequently traveled tourist locations, I would be more suspicious about their origin. After visiting the site and viewing the tracks, I was able to resolve some of the concerns raised by Rick. The tracks measued at a full 14 inches, maybe a bit more. Stride was considerable: 48"" between same points in opposing feet and up to 112"" between same points in same foot. Snow was 18"" deep at the track site. Tracks penetrated 12"" deep on average. The stretch of the trail with the tracks is north facing and preservation of the tracks has been aided by the lack of sun that strikes the snow in that shaded portion of the roadway. While it is possible that a hiker removed his shoes and socks and took about twenty steps off the trail in the deep snow, the stride is too long for comfortable human strides. I was able to match the stride by running on the trail beside the prints and virtually leaping between steps. It would be exhausting to accomplish this in bare feet and in the deep snow at the 3500 foot elevation, but it is clearly *possible* for a determined person with large feet to have made these tracks. Therefore, it seems unlikely to me that someone would go to this trouble in such a remote place. Further, I saw several other possible barefoot tracks in other places along the trail, but greater sun exposure deteriorated them to the point where nothing can be determined for certain. The tracks that were clearly evident looked to be about one week old. The last heavy mountain snow was 3/14-3/16. My guess is that the tracks were made right after this, before the snow developed the stiff crust from sun exposure that it has now. I favor the view that the tracks are genuine sasquatch tracks. If genuine, why would the tracks be there? Perhaps a bigfoot was travelling down Table Rock Creek toward the warmer forested lowlands along the Molalla River. Or, could it be a resident sasquatch roaming it's home range? Either way, the compacted snow of the Table Rock trail provides much easier travelling than trekking across deep and trackless snow. The many boot prints on the trail also offers a means to travel without leaving discernible tracks if an animal wished to conceal its passing. Some of us favor the view that bigfoots make efforts to conceal their movements whenever possible. The numerous boot prints on the compacted snow trail would make recognition of individual tracks difficult. So, why then, would one of these animals step out of the packed snow of the trail and leave these conspicuous tracks? From the size of the feet and the look of the track run, I envision an older juvenile or young adult that stepped out of the trail but soon found the going to be strenuous and returned to the trail. Speculation might include a strong-willed adolescent or two individuals sharing a narrow trail and jockeying for position. In any case, the Molalla River area and specifically the Table Rock Creek locality has historic bigfoot activity extending over many years. Some field researchers consider it to be a hotbed of bigfoot activity. While investigating the site at 5pm on 3/20/01, I did some elk calls and other animal calls. After doing my call, I heard two animal noises that I could not identify. The first was a single, shrill, loud scream. The other unfamiliar sound was a low ""whump-whump-whump-whump-whump-whump"" sound that quickened as it repeated seven times. it repeated several times and I taped it on my camcorder. I thought of a grouse drumming but this noise was slower than the quick ""thumpa-thumpa-thumpa-thumpa-thump"" of grouse durmming that I'm familiar with. -Thom Powell",NA,yes,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=1986

The creature was viewed at a distance of approximately 130 feet when a car’s headlights backlit the creature as it ran from left to right across the road from the witnesses perspective. The occupants of the car where not identified or contacted, but did stop a short distance from the creature, insinuating that the driver also observed the sighting. The creature was running fast, upright, very hairy, humanoid in appearance, and estimated to be 7 feet tall (definitely larger than the witness who is 6’3”). The local dogs were barking excitably, which is why the witness looked out the window. A search for footprints with flashlights was unsuccessful for finding clues or footprints.

The family dog, a large protective crossbreed was outside chained up to his runner. The dog started to bark and the other neighbors dogs barked as well, which is considered normal. However, the barking increased more excitably, enough so for Ben to take notice. Looking out the north-facing window in the Living room, Ben saw an approaching automobile driving towards him down his road approaching HWY. #26. He then saw the creature run from left to right across his road, backlit by the approaching car. The car slowed, and Ben felt that the occupant(s) of the car saw the creature as well, enough so to slow down almost to a stop. The car and occupants continued and are unknown. The view is partially blocked by trees but Ben was sure of what he saw. After telling his sister she decided to leave for her mother's work around the corner while Ben went to the back door to get the dog inside. The dog was still curious and didn't initially want to come in. Ben noticed a ""bad"" smell outside, and got the dog inside. I was originally told of the possible bigfoot sighting at approximatly10:30 PM by the witness's Mother at her work a quarter mile from the sighting. The witness's 20-year-old sister was also present at the mother's workplace and was obviously distressed by her brothers sighting. I arrived at the Witness's home at 11:00 PM to meet and interview the witness Ben Stites (18 years old). I initially asked what Ben saw and he excitably explained he saw what he thought to be a Bigfoot. I asked why he thought so, and he described the following; ""creature was large - about 7 feet tall, very hairy, ran upright very fast across the road."" He wasn't sure what it was but didn't think it was a bear. Bear sightings were reported in the immediate area during September and early October. He asked me if I thought it might have been a bear and I responded that I don't think bears run very fast standing upright, which he emphasized. Ben seemed to be forthright and brief in his experience; further emphasizing he was being honest and not embellishing. I asked Ben if he would show me where he saw the creature and he agreed. His sister, who was now home too, asked if we should bring the baseball bat, which was lying on the coach in the living room? I took this to be evidence of concern at the time. We didn't take any weapons. We left his home by the front door with flash lights, walked to the road and turned right and walked approximately 100 feet to where the creature was seen. Ben's road is narrow, with few neighbors in a forested area. While walking to the seen Ben was noticeably excited and kept looking around. By checking back at the angle of his home he identified the crossing point, approximately 30 feet shy of the next two driveways on either side of the road. Approximately 130 feet from the window he viewed the creature. A very small building similar to an entry post of a military entrance at the neighbors’ driveway helped Ben to identify the sighting location. I tried to see with my flashlight if any footprints existed at the edge of the road on both sides and up both driveways. Being careful of our steps, no footprints of any kind were seen. The edge of the road was muddy. The forest among the houses in the area has lower brush and foliage, including many ferns. Several ferns were noticeably broken at the roads edge but couldn't be identified as ""fresh."" After estimating distances and locations, we returned to Ben's home. It is my opinion than Ben saw what was described above. Ben does not have a history of embellishing stories, although teenagers are probably more demographically probable of making up stories for attention. -Rob Gracie",yes,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=3441

BFRO,Oregon,Clackamas,8888,NA,2004,June,19-22,Summer,B,vocalization,footprint,"I was at a friend's house in the Colton area. It was around midnight when I noticed strange noises in the treeline approx. 100 yards from his house. These noises were birdlike in nature and seemed to be coming from 3 places, directly in front of the house and off to both sides and further away. These noises sounded like birds but were only part of a bird call, and they seemed to be answering each other. There were 5 different noises and while they seemed birdlike they definitely came from something larger than a bird. At approx. 12:30 am I finally asked the other people at the house to come outside and listen. Everyone agreed that the noises were strange and like nothing they had ever heard before. We shined a flashlight in the area that noises seemed closest and saw nothing due to heavy brush, but the noises quit in that area until we stopped shining the light. These noises lasted until approx. a half an hour until dawn and quit quite suddenly. I grew up in the area and spend alot of time hunting and fishing and being in the outdoors, as does the property owner, we could not identify any local animal that makes these noises. In the morning we went and looked in the area closest to the house and found want could 2 possible tracks, they matched nothing we had ever seen, and we compared them with the other animal tracks in the area and they matched nothing, also noticed that the grass was pushed down in approx 3-4 foot strides running through the field behind the stream area where we found the possible tracks and where we thought some the noises were coming from. Since then the property owner has heard the same noises at night and last night heard something thrashing around in the brush.

We walked only about 25 ft from the gravel road and a huge sound of bushes/trees crackling and breaking came from our left. I saw the disturbance out of the corner of my eye and when I looked over, I could see the brush moving violently about 10 ft beyond our path. I didn't see any thing but there was an enormous two or three steps traveling away from us and I could feel the vibration of the weight of the steps under my own feet. That was no deer or elk, the pounding of steps was too heavy and there was a distinct - one step, then a broad second step hitting the ground.

BFRO,Oregon,Clackamas,24882,Scott Taylor,2008,August,10,Summer,A,animal,activity,"Near the end of August, this year 2008 a couple of friends and I went camping/Bigfoot hunting around the upper Collawash River in the Oregon Cascade Range east of Estacada with the intensions of finding a spot I had been told about by a guide on a whitewater rafting trip I had taken with my brother in 2006. Unfortunately, when we got to our destination, I was the only one in our group that wanted to look for Bigfoot. Disappointed but not dissuaded, I tried to keep the rest of the group (2 guys and 1 girl) at least somewhat interested in the Bigfoot search, to little avail. The first night we camped (under much protest) quite a way into the bush and away from the overcrowded camp grounds where everyone felt more comfortable. We followed an old logging road until it ended at a very secluded spot atop a ridge and maybe 250 to 350 yards directly south of the clear cut power line running east/west. The first night was interesting as we continued to hear distinct wood knocking; they started at around 11:00pm. Most were far off and very fast, 4 to 7 quick, sharp cracks directly east of us that would echo across the valley only to be answered from another direction farther south and then north but at first they were pretty far off. Everyone thought they were gunshots but this was a really dark night and these sounds were coming from pretty deep in the thick forest accessed only by not well traveled logging roads and from at least 3 different sources that for the life of me, sounded like they were communicating so I ruled out gunshots. These sounds continued to get closer to our campsite as the night wore on. At one point, maybe 12:30 or 1:00am the group wanted to drive over to the power lines, where the trees weren’t so thick and you could see for several miles, I decided to stay at camp and hope for something to happen. Almost immediately after everyone left, I started hearing sticks breaking from the direction they had driven out on and everything got real quiet. Now I’m from Montana and have spent many a night camped alone in far more rugged mountains than I was in now and have experienced most of the wildlife at least partially up close and personal that our American forests have to offer but I gotta tell you, I got a little spooked while they were gone! I did what any self respecting outdoors man would do and…put a lot more wood on the fire! I didn’t hear anything at that time that sounded too bizarre but I was glad when everyone got back. My buddy asked me if I was knocking rocks together while they were gone. I told him I hadn’t and asked what they heard. He said that they were out looking at the valley from the top of the road we came in on, about 250 to 350yards away and they all heard distinct knocking coming from the direction of our camp, he said it sounded like rock on rock. Later after everyone had gone to their tents I again decided to stay up. At around 3:30am I heard a very low grumble with a huff followed by what sounded like a lot of breath being pushed out and very close to the fire, maybe 30ft. At first I thought it was a bird or something, then, almost immediately another answered the first from across the clearing we were camped in directly behind me. I put my flashlight on where I heard the sound coming from and it would stop. 10 min later it would start up again. I don’t know why I didn’t get anyone up to listen with me but I didn’t. This went on for about an hour, until the sun started to brighten the sky and you could see a lot better. I never heard walking or anymore sticks breaking but those grunting noises were definitely close and there was at least 2 of whatever was making them. It wasn’t until on our way home that my buddy told me that he had heard the grunts too and, I love this, he was too scared to get up and investigate. The next day we went looking for another campground. I didn’t want to leave but I was definitely the minority on the subject. As we were driving down, I believe was FR43, my buddy and I in his rig and his friends behind us in theirs, something very big ran across the road about 150yrds in front of us. It was dark brown or black and uniform in color and at least 8ft to 9ft tall and moving like a freight train, it was huge! We only saw it for maybe a second before it tore into the trees running from the right to the left. My skeptical buddy looked at me and said “Did you see that!” I had my video camera in my lap but there was no way I could have gotten a shot of this thing, it was really moving! We stopped where we thought it crossed the road and you could see quite clearly where something had came down the incline on the right side of the road, we didn't smell anything. We got out and I climbed the small incline that it had come down to investigate and after 30 min or so found a barefoot track 18” long x 7½” wide and got video of it. I can send you the video and have other stories of the area as well. We did have material to cast the print but since it was in the mossy ground that covers most of the Oregon forest my buddy refused to cast the print claiming that we wouldn’t get anything from it. I was furious but it was his stuff and I learned the hard way to pack your own gear! when i climbed the incline after we saw the thing cross the road, something tore off away from me which would have been heading south west into the forest when i peaked the incline. very noisy! Also, the track I found was definitely older, i don't think it was made at the time of the sighting. There where many other partial tracks in the general area, some quite large others just looked like scuff marks. the one i videotaped was without question the best one we found.

We were approximately 10 ft. from the creature which appeared to be standings somewhat erect, but when it ran it ran with its hands on the ground like a monkey or gorilla.

He commented to the driver that the jeep must have just hit an animal, so he should slow the car down. -The witness' vehicle was traveling about 5 to 10 miles per hour, and was very close to the creature when it jumped onto the road, possibly as close as 10 feet, to run behind their car. -The creature ran from the north side of the road to the south. -The car in front of them stopped, and the car behind them took evasive action to avoid hitting the animal as it ran behind the witnesses. -The creature quickly changed its direction to avoid being hit by the car behind the witnesses. Its movements were “inhuman” and had an “animal's quickness”. -The driving witness commented to the passenger, “That was an ape!” -As the creature ran across the road, several of the witnesses in the other cars blew their horns, including the reporting witnesses. -The creature is described as having light brown hair (“like a brown bear”), very long arms, a stooping gait, and a thick build “like a linebacker”. -It's face was seen by the driver as it sprang from the woods. It had a wide-eyed expression on its face that the witness interpreted as fear and panic. Its mouth was “tight-lipped”, and no teeth were visible. The face was described as being human-like and light brown colored. The witness compared the face to an orangutan's face, but again, very human-like. -The creature sprang from the woods on two legs, but it had a forward-leaning gait that left its hands barely off the ground. -It galloped quadrupedally across the road by putting its right arm forward with its left leg forward, and alternating in this pattern. It's back legs moved like a man running whether it was on all fours or running bipedally. -When on all fours it ran on its knuckles, not on an open hand.",NA,yes,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=24631
BFRO,Oregon,Clackamas,26497,Kristi Sanders,2009,August,25,Summer,B,vocalization,NA,"ok, I'm 34 so what I'm about to tell you , I am still having trouble accepting, I've wondered about this since I was little. Now I KNOW,..... August 25, 2009 my girlfriend, her two boys and I went camping at my usual spot. This location was picked due to the isolation factor; it's 10 miles up logging roads near Estacada, Oregon. I will not disclose the GPS cords. or even close to prox., This is MY spot. Nothing abnormal occured over the day or night of the 24th, and the day of the 25th was normal events like gathering wood for the coming night. We had put the boys down for the night just after sun down. We were hanging around the fire chatting and poking the fire. Being who I am, I began making noise to hear it echo through the trees. You know, rooster noises and some whooping, basic idiot noises (approx. 1130 pm). I do this at times to keep bigger game from coming through camp. Well, I got one hell of a shock about 15 minutes later. We were walking back toward the fire from the truck, the fire was only bright glowing coals at this point, and BOOM, shock to the system!!!! Out of the pitch black night....one of the most unreal sounds I've ever heard in my life came rushing through the dark. It was a hair stiffening scream that at that moment I couldn't match in my memory of noises over the 20 years I've been going into nature to escape. This was the first time in my life that I felt a need to get out of nature, QUICKLY. The sound pushed through the trees like the trees were not even there. Even the air around us seemed to vibrate. From experience I have had in the woods through my life, and tracking sounds and distance, I'm estimating that this scream was being produced about 200 yards away. It was so loud that nothing I know of could make this big of a noise. There is no animal I have come accross that has the lungs to produce such a loud, long and vocalized sound as this ""creature"" produced. Let me put it this way....if someone told me they heard it, I would be trying to put a K9 responsible, but hearing it myself and knowing of nothing I've ever encountered could make that sound. Now, I did not stand there much longer. I think I may have pushed my girlfriend up into the truck so I could get in ASAP. As soon as I was in, the lights were on and the horn going for about 3 seconds to try to keep it from getting closer. It seemed to work because the volume started to fade a bit. We decided to get camp up and get out. over the minutes it took us to completely tear down camp, maintain a track on movement of the screams and shove camp into the truck, the screamig continued and moved. From the time it started ,it was at 2 o'clock from the camp. While we were packing up, it moved clockwise around to about 5 o'clock from camp. This all took about 30 minutes before we were on our way down hill. The screams continued even on our way out. To make it completely clear, I've done alot in my life. Anything from solo hunting at the age of 12 and up to my time in the military, Iv'e never been spooked even with rounds wizzing past.....BUT that scared me to the point of every hair from the top of my toes to the top of my head were at attention! Now, after the fact, realizing what it was.....YES, I am going back with recording gear.

It was difficult to tell what direction it was comeing from, it seemed to surround us. It was a high-pitched screaming sound with whoops, reminicent to a siren and it was fairly continuous. It sounded otherworldly and struck fear into us instantly. We froze in terror and listened for about 30 seconds as the screaming whoops got louder and closer-sounding. Then we ran to the truck and honked the horn like crazy. The sounds continued and we sat listening for a good ten minutes as the sounds continued but seemed to move further away. We exited the truck and tore down camp immediately, pausing every few minutes to monitor the distance of the sounds, jumping into the truck for a minute or so again when the sounds would get close, honking the horn occasionally for good measure. We pulled out of camp at 1145 PM. On the drive down the hill we spotted a deer crossing the road. When we got home exhasted as we were we got right on the computer and googled coyote calls to compare to what we heard.

I had a 55 gallon drum of goat guts & beef guts with a sheep carcass in the back of my truck. Within 2 hours loud screams came from the ridge over the campground. On the second day we heard wood knocks and heavy steps, and twigs snapping before 4:00 am. We noticed our portable camp table had been bitten through.

One of the accounts he described on the phone was a camping trip at the same location some months prior where he heard what he believed to be ""a bigfoot hollering."" He then went on to describe this most recent weekend camping trip to the lake, accompanied by a couple of male friends with specific intent of baiting the creature with a 55 gallon barrel of slaughterhouse by-products consisting of goat and beef entrails as well as a sheepskin with head intact. Having left the barrel in the back of his truck, the gentlemen proceeded to wind down for their first night of camp. Very soon up on the ridge, 100 yards north of the campsite, loud indecipherable vocalizations not attributable to bear or other known wild animals, began to emanate from the top of the ridge along with tree breaking and ""stomping."" The next day very early from inside their tents, all three men heard more vocalizations and even closer ""stomping."" When preparing breakfast, the party noticed that their plastic top metal-framed camp table appeared to have been bitten through. See photo: They decided at that point to dump the guts away from camp, as they were beginning to fear for their safety. Subsequent trips to the ""gut pile"" revealed most of the bait to be missing. After carefully reviewing the account of the witness, I decided to visit the location myself and spent three consecutive nights there in the latter days of July 2013. My campsite was approximately 75 yards from his location. The first night there I went to a very high ridge approximately 1.25 miles away and performed several tree knocks and blasted some short ""whoop"" calls myself - both exercises yielded no apparent response. I made my way back to my camp, energized a vehicle-affixed FLIR PathFindIR, and positioned my tripod-mounted parabolic audio recorder facing the ridge where the witness heard the night vocalizations and activity approx 175 yards away. My tent, and the tent where my young sons and their 13 year-old companion had bedded down, were in between the audio array and the ridge above. I turned in at about midnight. At approximately 2:35 AM, according to the audio recorder time stamp, the attached audio of tree fall and associated forest floor movement was recorded. The following morning, I spoke with several other campers in the campground and all remarked on the “boom” heard during the night. * Recording * The next day I investigated the area from where the tree fall crash appeared to occur. Indeed there was a very large apparently healthy fir approximately 12 inches in diameter and 70 feet in height, freshly downed with the top of the tree pointing in the direction of my campsite. The roots were still intact to the trunk, and it appeared that it had been pushed down. The tree trunk and roots, and gaping hole in the ground, were approximately three feet from another apparently healthy tree that was still standing, and that tree had what appeared to be hair caught in the bark at about 6 foot from the ground on the same side facing the felled tree. The remaining two nights of my stay transpired uneventfully. Thermal video data was analyzed, and the limited range of the camera prevented the capture of heat signatures to further analyze the tree-felling event. After speaking with the witness upon my return, I found his entire series of events to be corollary to my own experience and determined that his accounts were factual to the best of his observational capabilities. Based on the combined data gathered from all of the events, as well as a rich history of bigfoot reports from the area, I concluded that there was a high likelihood that the events in that location during last weeks of July 2013 were attributable to bigfoot activity.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=41709

Their campsite was located close to a path that lead to the river and was next door to one of the campground comfort stations. There was only one other campsite occupied in the campground, also a couple, and it was on the other side of the campground about 60-70 yards away. The witness related having been awakened at approx 5AM by the very loud, very close, ""human-sounding"" groans. He described the sound as ""almost human"" but so deep and loud that that the sound vibrated his diaphragm. His girlfriend was awake and asked him if he had heard the ""three grunts"" and he knew instantly that he was not dreaming, and that it was not a figment of his imagination. The witness remarked that his experience with bear raiding a campsite usually involved rifling through the cooking gear, and in this case, there were pots and pans as well as plates with food residue still on them left out on the picnic table that were not disturbed in any way. Also, he could not visualize a bear grunting in such a way to have heard it 2 feet above the ceiling of his 6-1/2 ft tent from a distance of about 6-7 feet from the back wall of the tent.

BFRO,Oregon,Clackamas,45347,Geoff Robinson,2014,June,6,Summer,B,vocalization,wood knock,"The main river in this area and the surrounding county can be a double-edged sword, a vast wilderness smack up against a major population–Portland Oregon. With numerous rock quarries used to create the logging roads, at times the shooters make the canyons sound like a war zone. But as soon as playtime is over and evening sets in, people head back down the hill and the war zone transforms into a more serene and mysterious place. Booms and blasts are replaced with the sounds of the wind blowing through the firs, birds chirping and camp conversations. When night falls, another reality becomes quickly apparent. This area has one of the highest instances of Sasquatch encounters in the country. Like many, I have reviewed lots of evidence online and from word of mouth, all the while wrestling with a degree of skepticism. This was not my first experience with this group leader, but it would prove to be my most memorable to date. We arrived at camp somewhere in the 2:30 to 3:00 PM range, set-up and planned for that night’s scouting. As the sun set and dusk turned to dark, the group leader gathered us together. Having sized up the territory and considered several scenarios, he shared his thoughts about that night’s approach. A particularly important point he mentioned was that it was vital to remain flexible, and open to the possibility of modifying our plans if new evidence presented itself. So the initial direction was decided and tactics clarified. He had selected an old closed road farther up the ridge, up against the beginning of the older growth (probably 2nd growth) timber. Access to the road had been blocked years before by a berm, impossible for cars, yet fairly easy to traverse on foot. It was roughly midnight as we crossed the berm into what can only be described, based on everyone’s sudden change of mood, as “someone or something else’s world”. The wind had finally all but stopped and it was now deathly quiet, except for the crunching of rocks under our boots. The brightness of the waxing moon lit the landscape and our company in shadowy shades of black and grey, with silvery highlights. Our shadows were black and well defined. One gentleman of our five-man team, a young veteran of a middle-east war, proudly clad in his fatigues, walked point, followed by the group leader and his son. I was next, having made sure to place myself as close to the middle of the company as possible, and finally, the oldest man in our group picked up the rear of the column. I think that older gentleman understood the value of being last, increasing the chance of being selected for contact. The old road cut across a slope near the top of the ridge. Below, a steep drop-off, choked with new growth, rhododendron and an assortment of other lush Western Oregon varieties of undergrowth. Above us, a dark shadowy stand of old trees, with silvery snags strewn throughout the forest floor; the wildest, most rugged terrain this area offers. We approached a large dead tree that had fallen across the road. As each in the company climbed over the log, signaling yet another barrier into another world, the group leader stopped. He had been carrying a tree knocker and now he would put it to good use. It was time to announce our presence. The group leader let loose with two sequences of knocks– “pop pop… pop, then pop, pop”. Each hit echoed through the forest and rebounded off the steep canyons with the force of a home-run. We all had enough experience to stay completely quiet and wait for a possible response. No crunching boots, no wind, dead silence. After a couple of minutes, we moved on. The older gentleman was the first to hear a response - a soft ""tap-tap."" He stopped the group for a listen. The first contact had been paralleling us from below, down the hill in the thick brush. We stopped and listened, nothing, then continued on. I began nervously glancing back down the road behind our column. I couldn’t help but wonder if I might catch a brief glimpse of a dark figure slipping quietly across the road back up into the timber. We then came to a bend in the road. There was a wide turn-out covered with ground cover. Our eyes had continued to adjust, so the moon now lit our position on the landing like a large street light. Just as my mind was focused on all of this, just when I least expected it, the real knocking began. At that moment, reality changed forever and everyone was transformed. All eyes, all thoughts, all senses were now directed toward the dark timber. Not 50 feet away the knocking continued. There among the old trees a shadowy figure, an intelligence controlling a hand, with an opposable thumb, wielding possibly a large stick, sending knocking sounds echoing through the dark cathedral forest. The knocking patterns seemed to be a coded message, letting us know that whoever or whatever it was, knew we were there. The army vet turned to me, I can still remember the excitement in his eyes as he exclaimed: “that’s no woodpecker”, I replied: “this is real!”. I heard my name and quickly turned to see the rest of the group on the ground. The group leader quietly ordered me to get down. There we sat as the group leader exchanged sounds and words with a creature that I now realized for the first time in my life was 100% real and just 50 feet away. Everyone of us felt the rush of being fully and acutely present, alert and alive. During these moments, nothing else seemed to matter. I asked myself, can this really be happening? … It is! The group leader’s words may not have been understood, but his calming tone must have spoken volumes to the figure or figures beyond the tree-line. We felt, as they must have, that neither was there to threaten the other. The knocks were not aggressive, simply a way to let us know they were there. Once the group leader thanked them for allowing us to share their space, he suggested that it might be time to retreat and not push things any further. We began hiking back toward the cars. It soon became apparent that our progress was now being flanked, and so it was, with glowing yellow-green and red eyes, vocalizations, and rustling all the way back to where we had parked. The following night would further reveal why we had been so closely monitored. Once back we were a buzz, we realized that we had all just been transformed, born again.

It was a very stormy day and the surf was high, crashing over the rocks on the jetty and pounding the beach. From the viewing tower I saw a man-like figure walk down off the grassy area onto the beach. At first I did not think too much of this ""person"" out on the sands. Then I watched as the figure neared the edge of the water. It was waving its arms up and down facing the surf and the tower. There was another person on the tower with his daughter and they too saw the figure; we looked at each other with a ""what the hell is that"" look but said nothing and continued to watch this figure standing on the beach. At this point I noticed a pick up truck with its lights on approaching up the beach from the south. Then the scale of the figure really struck me; it had to be a good 8 feet tall or more. The figure quickly turned and moved very fast off the beach before the truck was in range. It did not run but rather ""strode"" the 30 or so yards to the dunes edge, then took one or two steps up the embankment and was gone. I was all excited and scared on what I has just seen. I decided to go to the nearest parking lot near where the figure came down on the beach and see if I could get another look at it. As I approached the beach I became even more afraid, the wind was so strong I could hear nothing but the roar of the surf and the howl of the wind through my coat's hood. My dog was anxious and stayed close to me. I went to the beach and found where it came down the sand hill, the sand was all torn up from its passage. But when I discovered the hill was an easy 10 foot high, I really became fearful and decided to return to my car and leave instead of following the tracks into the grass.

BFRO,Oregon,Clatsop,10097,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1993,September,4-6,Fall,A,animal,NA,"On Labor Day weekend 1993, some friends and I went camping for the weekend at a KOA campground near Fort Stevens, OR. In the late afternoon on the second day we were there, a group of five or six of us decided to skateboard on the bike trails between the campground and the Fort. We went to the Fort, walked around and looked, stayed for maybe an hour, and decided to head back to the campground. On the way back, I and one other skated about forty or fifty paces ahead of the others, when we noticed they had stopped. We got off our boards and walked ahead, so the others could catch up with us. We walked around a blind corner on the trail when we heard what sounded like a high pitched scream. My friend said, ""That sounds like a kid."" So we ran down the trail, assuming someone was hurt. While we were running, we heard a series of grunts, very low and very close. They sounded almost like a hog, only longer, and much louder and lower pitched. We stopped running, and I put my hands on my knees and crouched down, looking off the trail all around us to try to see where the sounds were coming from. Then I saw an animal about five feet off the trail, in the brush, approximatly 10 yards away from us, in the direction we had come from. We had run right past it. It was very hairy, and black, and at first glance, I thought it was a black bear(which I've seen before). But then it stood up and I realized it was crouching. The guy I was with was 6'2"", and it was a little taller than him. It swung around and began to run away from the trail into the brush. It ran like a man, much too agile to be a bear, and completely upright, swinging its arms in front of it as it ran to move the heavy brush out of its way. It didn't lumber side to side like a bear does when it stands on its hind legs. I remember being amazed after the incident that it could move so fast. Its speed was really amazing. It took about five very big strides into the brush, and we couldn't see it anymore. We could hear it running through the brush, though. There were a lot of sticks and deadfall on the ground, and the underbrush was pretty thick, so it made a hell of a lot of noise. The sound didn't get very far away from us, and then it just stopped. We ran up to where it had been crouched next to the trail, and stared into the brush for a couple of minutes, but we saw and heard nothing else. Then we got so scared we started running back to where the rest of the party was. The rest of the party laughed at us when we told them the story, so all of us stopped where we had seen the animal. We looked for tracks, or broken undergrowth, but there was so much dead brush on the ground we couldn't even tell where the thing had been crouched in the first place. To this day I remember what the animal looked like, though. It was between 6 and 7 feet tall, and had it been a man, I would have called his weight at about 270. Not great big, but still pretty big. It definitely stood upright like a bipedal animal, and it had pretty long arms with elbow joints. Its legs didn't look all that long, but it had knees, and it ran like a man, but extremely fast. It had black hair which was pretty long. Its back was darker colored than its front. It was late afternoon in early September, the sun was on it, and it was real close to us, so I got a pretty good look at it, however briefly. I can't stress enough how amazingly fast this thing was.

BFRO,Oregon,Clatsop,9547,NA,2004,June,NA,Summer,B,vocalization,NA,"June 2004 For three days at dawn, I heard a long series of calls, the first of which lasted for about half an hour. I was not fully awake for the first calling, and half awake, wondered if it was a screaming cow, being attacked or something. We have major preditors here, including a Mountain Lion. THIS WAS NOT A MOUNTAIN LION. We've heard their screams, and this was nothing like that. Each dawn, the calls occured for a shorter and shorter duration. I was wide awake on the second and third dawns. On the third day at dusk, there was a brief series of calls. It was the softest in volume. Since then, I have heard nothing. I live on one side of the Nehalem River valley, up a little on the ridge, and it sounded like the calls came from the opposite ridge which is very forested. The calls sounded like a huge howler monkey, sort of a whoooop whoooop whooooop who's pitch went up at the ending. As it progressed, the whooops got closer and closer together, until it was whooopwhoooopwhoooop, and then gradually faded out softly. This sound reverberated across the entire valley, which is perhaps one mile from ridge to ridge. I have lived in the woods of No Cal and Oregon, and heard many wild animals. This was not a wolf, coyote, owl, elk, mountain lion, or the cows and donkeys that are a mile away. This was much louder than the most emphatic sounds that these animals make.

BFRO,Oregon,Clatsop,24328,Kristi Sanders,2008,August,1,Summer,B,vocalization,NA,"On Friday morning, August 1, 2008 at about 2:35 AM, I was awakened from sleep in my rented 19 ft travel trailer to what initially sounded like a man yelling for his dog. My family and I were vacationing in Seaside, OR and we were staying at Circle Creek RV Park, located on Highway 101 about one mile south of the popular destination town. After being woken up, I listened for some time before getting up and asking my wife if she had heard what I was hearing. She had been sleeping with our two young sons at the opposite end of the trailer. What we both heard for the subsequent 25 minutes was a deeper voice calling, as if searching for someone. We could not make out what the person was saying, and it seemed odd to both of us that the vocalizations were exact replicas of each other, that is, each call sounded identical to the other. It was almost as if someone was walking around with a tape-recorded selection repeating plays in uneven short intervals. The vocalizations seemed to rapidly circle the RV park along a bordering creek and hedge-row. This movement of the sounds would have required the individual to be constantly running. My wife and I both observed out the windows in the trailer, looking for a flashlight or some other indication of someone searching. The security lighting in the RV park made it difficult to notice forms outside the perimeter. The tone and timbre, and completely unintelligible nature of the vocalization seemed similar to the ""samurai chatter"" recordings on the BFRO website. At one point the vocalizations became so close to our trailer and so loud that my wife became profoundly afraid. I began wondering if any of the other guests in the park had been awakened, and if they were shaken up as we were. At about 3 AM a car drove up from the highway and three passengers with flashlights exited the vehicle, and proceeded to their campsite. The car drove away. This activity brought silence to our unintelligible visitor, and we were not disturbed for the rest of the night. At 7 AM I asked the RV park manager if he had heard “all of the commotion” the previous night, and he said that he had not heard a thing. I was disappointed to be heading back to Portland that day, as I had hoped to talk with other park guests about the incident.","west on Hwy 26 out of Portland, north on 101 , 3 miles on the west side of highway",Seaside,Hwy 101,Circle Creek RV Park,45.9653131,-123.9263421,6.27,NA,235,NA,rain,new moon,0,"coastal ridge, clear cuts , coastal range",NA,NA,NA,25,50.29,165.0,55,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,circling campground,NA,running,NA,samurai chatter,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,"""Feeling I got there was it was like a thorough fare, where they could cross the road there safely, and the tide was out, and it was raining.

She went to the bathroom, which is on the NW corner of her house, and looked out the window that was facing west. She saw a brownish-black creature walking upright. It crossed-by her line of sight going north. It was 20 feet away, and from her vantage point she was able to see about 10 feet of its travel. She shifted position to the north window, and watched it walk up the slope to the cemetery north of her property. It walked past an old tombstone, and then through some berry bushes. She remembers that it had a very blocky build, with square shoulders. As it walked, she viewed its right side, and then after shifting to the north window was watching it as it walked away. Later, she went out and took some photos. Here is one showing where the creature walked. On the right side is the west bathroom window. She went to the tombstone, and standing next to it, it came to her waist. She is 5’6” tall, and in her estimation the creature was over 7 feet tall.

BFRO,Oregon,Coos,8745,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1949,August,NA,Summer,A,vocalization,animal,"Something was pounding on something like a log. That brought one of my brothers into the house to alert the rest of the family to ""Come hear this."" We went outside & stood in the driveway, and heard the most frightening guttural roar you can imagine! This accompanied the pounding on the wood object. This lasted several minutes. The evening was clear, warm, without wind. I do not remember a moon. Neither brother could explain what was happening and I recall being scared out of my wits! When the sounds subsided, the family returned inside. The incident was not discussed in front me again. As a child, I was privledged to live in this remote beautiful area and allowed to run free. Sometime later, a boy friend & I observed what we were told must have been a bear in a thicket of alder trees near the house. The feces found there later contained crawdad shells and berry seeds, with a horrible odor, but the creature we saw was not a bear. The hard dry ground showed no tracks. Our fathers were loggers and we were well versed in the local wild life. While this all happened a very long time ago, I still get cold chills remembering those sounds. Years later, my fiance & I were driving North on Oregon's Hwy 101 near Cape Perpetua North of Florence, OR. The highway is narrow, two lane, with Pacific Ocean on the West & steep rock cliffs on the East. I was watching the moon over the ocean, turned sidewise, facing the ocean. A very large black creature rose from a cleft in the cliff and towered over the little car we were in. My fiance yelled ""What the hell was that?"" I only caught a glimpse of the thing through my peripheral vision, but it was huge and very fast. I suppose we surprised it as much as it surprised us. It terrified me. My fiance searched for a place to turn around as he wanted to go back, and I refused to let him. We were armed with what suddenly seemed to be a very small weapon, considering the size of the creature! When we returned home, my fiance told his father about the encounter. His father told us of the rancher at the foot of the Capes (Also on Hwy 101) who had been riding to check on his cattle when he heard a cow bellowing in agony. His horse became nervous but he forced it on and found a very large hairy animal chewing on the live cow. He carried a 30.06 rifle and shot the creature. It stood up and ran off on two legs. He followed until he lost the trail of blood in the rocky terrain. This is the first time I have ever heard of someone shooting and wounding one of these creatures. It is also the first time I've heard of this creature eating meat of any kind. Our encounter was in the late evening with clear skies and a full moon. My fiance saw the creature in the headlights and had a great view of it. He knew it was not a bear, and didn't think it was human in a fur suit.

The location was outside the town of Myrtle Point, Oregon on [omitted] where my parents lived on 10 acres. I didn't live with them at the time, but had walked to their place from town that day and met them on the road as they were driving into town.....they were going out for the evening and told me I could spend the night at the house and they'd see me later on. It was late in the afternoon when I arrived at the house and just went in and watched TV for awhile. After about an hour or so, I heard the dogs barking.....they often barked at deer that would come near the house, so I peeked out the window behind the couch where I sat to see if I could see them. I didn't see anything, but smelled what I thought was the septic tank.....it was awful. Back to watching TV....it was getting darker now and I could hear the dogs again, but they were screaching and saw them run past our front door (the door was all glass panes) and heard them run into the garage. That smell again and it was stronger and I looked out the window again to see why the dogs ran away, but still saw nothing. Soon I heard a noise outside the window I had been looking out of. Someone was walking on the plank just outside the window and sounded like he was headed toward the front door, so I sat back and looked to see who it was. I saw a tall, dark figure walking past the door, but in it's stride, it's head turned and saw me watching. It stopped at the door and turned toward me. It stood there watching me and in my fear I must have passed out, because the next thing I remembered was my parents picking me up from the floor....how I ended up there, I'll never know, but my folks said I was white as a ghost and were afraid when they saw me, that I was dead. My dad ran out the door right away with flashlight in hand, when I was able to tell them what happened, but I was sure it had been hours past and it had rained. He came back with nothing. The creature was taller than the door, but was slightly hunched when it was walking past the door. The eyes were small compared to the size of its head and piercing. It had hair all over, but I could see its skin easily and I could see that it was a female by its breasts, which had less hair. Its face was rather flat and the head was long. It had a short neck.

BFRO,Oregon,Coos,1031,NA,1980,February,NA,Winter,A,animal,NA,"My name is John R. This incident occurred in early 1980 near Arago, about 5-7 miles from Lampa Mountain. I had a paper route then and I was delivering newpapers from my truck to the residents of that area. It has been so long ago I don't remember the road name, but it was about 0330 and it was raining slighty when I came around a sharp corner in the road and saw the back of a large animal quickly crossing the roadway and climbing the side of the roadcut. The road cut was covered with grass about 2 feet high and was about 10 feet high and proabably at a 70 degree angle. As large bears are common in this area due to the sheep population, I initially assumed it was a reddish brown colored bear I was driving by. The animal must have been at least 6 foot long and had very long hair along its spine. I remember very clearly the part in the hair along the spine, due to the wet weather. I passed within 15 feet of the animal as it climbed very quickly to the top of the road cut and out of sight. What always struck me as odd is that the animals spine did not flex like that of a bear when it was moving, and that its rear legs were not directly under it, more out to its sides as it climbed out of sight. It also had very large, broad shoulders.

BFRO,Oregon,Coos,3297,NA,1995,November,14,Fall,A,animal,NA,"First let me begin by saying that I began going hunting with my Dad when I was about 5 years old. I have spent a great deal of time in the forest. I have been fortunate to have seen almost every species of animal that we have in the state. In Alaska I have seen a Kodiak Bear, Caribou, Blue Foxes, Moose. You name it I have seen it. On the fourth day of our Elk Hunt on November 14, 1995. It was Overcast, but not raining. There were 5 people in our hunting party. The hunt was for 3 point or better bull elk. I was on a treeline/ridgeline trail that was following both down the edge of a reprod unit that was approximately 15 years old. There was another ridge approximately 50 yards accross from where I was. It was approximately 40 yards to the bottom of the ravine and an equal distance back up the other side. I was doing the usual as I made my way down the trail. Go a few yards stop look and listen. From the corner of my eye, I spotted some movement off to my right on the next ridge over. It was about 70 yards as the crow flies at the time I first saw it. My first thought was that the hunter must have a death wish wearing that color clothes out here. Then I quickly realized that it was not a man at all. The Bigfoot was walking upright on two feet. It did not have four legs, but two arms and two legs. It covered 30 yards distance in a few strides. I still had not ruled out that it could be a hunter. By this time it was not more than 45 yards directly accross from where i was kneeled down at. The Bigfoot stopped in a small patch of the reprod where there weren't any small trees. But, there was a downed alder tree that made a wishbone shape. Like a Y. The alder was laying on the hillside, the bottom of the Y would have been on the left side of my field of vision, the downhill side, the right side of the Y was laying on the ground, and the left side of the Y was up in the air. Can you picture this? I could clearly see by now that this was not a man, bear or any other animal that I have ever seen before in my life. Not in pictures, or in person. I put my little nikon binoculars up on it and watched to see more details of it. It did not have pointy ears that a bear would have had. Nor the big square head. What this Bigfoot did next amazed me, it put one of its big hands on the upper part of the alder. Then it proceeded to swing it's legs over the alder and sit down on the alder like you or I would sit on a fence rail. Can you picture this? It now had it's back to me. Then it sat there, by now I was a little scared.. I knew that this Bigfoot probably had some family somewhere in the vicinity, say 1/4 to 1/2 mile of where we were. I was pretty scared. By now I had determined that this Bigfoot was not a man, and I had drawn my Remington Model 721 chambered in .270 Winchester on him to see him through my scope, and for extra security. The scope was a Simmons 3x9 Deerfield II. I kneeled there on the knob where I was for at least 30 minutes and watched it. I whistled and made attempts to make the Bigfoot turn and look at me. I had my finger on the trigger as I watched all this time. The Bigfoot sat on that alder and his legs were swinging like you or I would swing them on a fence rail. The Bigfoot was reaching with his arms and picking foliage up, and I presume it was eating it. I couldn't see for sure because it's back was still to me. After about 30 minutes I decided that I needed to get going because It was approaching 2:00 pm and would be dark before 4:00 in the trees. The only way down would have been to walk my ridge down and it would have crossed the trail Bigfoot was on about 100 yards downhill from where I was. I was about 1 mile down from the beginning of the ridge. It was a good 4 or 5 miles by road to where the vehichles would be on the bottom. I turned heel and made my way up the ridge line trail as fast as I could, looking over my shoulder all the while. Until it was out of my site it remained on that same alder sitting there swinging it's legs. I walked the mile or so up the ridgeline trail to the old skid road that I broke off of to begin with. When I got to the gravel road I never turned back. It was about 4 miles to the bottom flats and I walked at a brisk pace. I got down to the vehichles around 3:00 and everyone was worried that I didn't come out on the creekbed trail. I had made this same run numerous times. One of my hunting partners even shot a 6x6 bull within 50 yards of where I saw and watched the Bigfoot, he shot it the previous year. November of 1994. I have been back there to that same spot since then. I could take you to the exact spot where that Bigfoot was. Since that experience I have seen two different ""footprints"" within a 2 mile radius of where I saw the Bigfoot at. I was with two other people when I saw them. I could easily fit my size 10 boot inside the print. with 2-3 inches on the front left and 2 inches on the back so we are talking about a foot like Shaquille O'Neal. Size 20 at least. When you respond I will have the exact road names and numbers for you. If you are wondering credibility because it is so late in the evening. I was on my way home and my girlfriend asked if I believed in it and why nobody could prove it. It prompted me to get on the net and look for any sites. I have never reported this to anyone outside of hunting party and a few close friends. I can still picture it like it was this afternoon though. I will never forget what I saw that day. I thank you for your time and look forward to hearing back from you. This is 100% true and real.","near Headwaters Ridge on 8800 Road in Elliot State Forest , accesible thorugh 9500 road",Ash,Loon Lake Road,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1400,NA,overcast,waning gibbous,59,forest,"coniferous trees , ferns",NA,NA,30,41.15,135.0,45,NA,1,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,brown,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,hair had lighter tones of brown on shoulders and down back,NA,"walked up to and sat on alder branch , swinging legs while sitting",NA,walking,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"The witness is an experienced outdoorsman.

BFRO,Oregon,Coos,9276,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,2004,August,21-22,Summer,B,footprint,NA,"I entered this part of the Coos County Forest at its western edge, looking for possible hiking trails that I could follow to the top of the hills. I walked east along an old dirt logging road but it ended at the edge of a steep creek. The brush was very thick and I couldn't get through so I followed the creek in a southerly direction, walking through the ""slash"" (all the debris left over from clear cutting.) Actually, stumbling is a more apt description of my mode of travel. If you've been in a clear cut you know what I mean. Anyhow, I came upon a small spot of soft dirt next to a trunk and saw a footprint about an inch deep. It was a bare foot and just slightly bigger than my male size 10 1/2 in combat boots. I could plainly see the toes. I couldn't imagine how anyone could walk barefooted in that area. I found I couldn't get where I wanted to go due to some wicked stickers so I left. I kept thinking about that print and decided to go back with a camera. Unfortunately, it rained for about 4 days. When it cleared up, I went back and stumbled around some more but it was washed pretty clean. However, I found some other prints that were bigger than the original, and some impressions that were smaller than my own foot (a youngster?). I tried taking pictures and can send them, but they aren't very clear. I could sort of see the track they took and I figured the stride to be about 6 feet between prints. The next day I entered the forest from the north. I followed a dirt road that led to another clearcut. From a high point I could see the area I had been in the day before, so I was sort of north-east of the original spot on the other side of the creek. I saw a beautiful deer and a snake there and found some more impressions. They appeared to be about 15 inches long with the same 6 foot stride. They were not well defined as the ground was hard and may have been made before the rain. I'm not a tracker, but I stood at the print and looked in the direction of travel and could see what appeared to be a trail. That's how I figured the stride. 2 of my strides=6 feet.

BFRO,Oregon,Coos,42352,Stephen Willis,2004,October,29,Fall,A,animal,vocalization,"Late Oct 2004. I was picking Matsutaki mushrooms near Storm Ranch in Coos County. I noticed free range cattle acting spooked so I kept my path moving in a clock wise motion. Periodically the cattle would sound off, but always behind me, roughly at my 7 o'clock. This happened for around 3 hours and when I decided to call it a night and hiked out to the road. When I got there I heard the cattle again. This time a huge bi- pedal animal ran up the side of the road directly at me. It was 7+ feet tall, huge shoulders, covered in reddish blonde, brown hair, no neck, pointed head, long arms and shorter legs. I could hear the bare feet slapping the road surface as it ran. I was frozen with fear. This thing came within 100 feet of me and stopped. I could see its breath as it stood there breathing heavily. After a few seconds, it turned away from me and with 2 bounds it cleared a two lane road, then jumped over a patch of sala brush. The brush stood 4' tall and extended off the road 20 feet.

BFRO,Oregon,Coos,67380,Kevin Llewellyn,2020,April,NA,Spring,B,activity,NA,"I wasn't going to report this incident, but I believe it is of major importance to the Bigfoot research community. I will try to keep it simple. I had recently purchased a used vehicle and we decided to take it for a test drive to Laverne Park, which is just a short drive into the mountains from where we live. I was with my girlfriend, her 14 year old daughter, and my dog. After passing the park, we drove on further to see the country. We found a right turn and followed the rural road up into the forest. I later found out that we were traveling up Moon Creek. Not long after heading up the road, my car started overheating. I didn't have water on me so I decided to stop at the first water source, which was a bridge of the creek. I pulled over and we got out. While stepping out of the truck by girlfriend said, "" hey, there is something walking on the hill above us"". We stopped and listened for a moment but it was quiet. I then looked for a place to collect some water from the creek but it turned out that the edge of the water was too steep to step down and get water from. So, I had come up with a quick plan to connect some string to a cup and ""fish"" the water from the bridge. While we were trying to get the cup to fill, a small stone was thrown at us and bounced on the concrete of the bridge we were on. I looked up and noticed a steep hillside above us wondering what the hell could throw a rock at us. I noticed my dog was sitting in my truck, which she never does while I'm out of it in the wilderness. I was getting a little spooked so I tried to speed up the process of getting the water in the cup. Then, another stone bounced on the bridge next to us. I literally watched it skip along the cement. I mentioned that we better hurry, and then, from somewhere up the hill, came a very large rock, about the size of a softball of larger. It smashed against a huge rock in the creek and busted into pieces. I stood up on the bridge, looked at my girlfriends daughter and said, ""let's go now!"" My girlfriend and dog were already in the truck when I slammed the hood down and dove inside. We drove down the mountain and pulled over. I had left so fast that I didn't put the radiator cap back on. I considered returning after getting water to try to get pictures, but my girlfriend wouldn't let us go back. Now, either somebody was on that steep hill in the middle of the forest screwing with us and throwing rocks, or something else was. If it was a person, they are mighty brave in a forest full of hunters and guns.

While the boyfriend was dropping string and cup over the bridge, two rocks landed four to five feet away from him. Each rock was just a little larger than a marble. He saw the second rock roll by him. Then the softball sized rock hit a large boulder that was thirty to forty feet away, in the water but near the edge of the creek. The rock shattered and the pieces landed in the water. No foul odor was detected. The witness is not sure what fish may be in this creek but has seen crawdads in it.

BFRO,Oregon,Crook,10034,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1989,November,4,Fall,B,wood knock,NA,"This incident took place during the first Oregon elk season in 1989.My hunting partner had business to tend to in town and had to take leave of our camp for a day. He had taken my truck and left me at camp with his truck and camper. I departed camp on Saturday morning, proceeding at a slow pace to the north/northwest. Neither of us had seen any elk since opening day, the previous Wednesday, so I wasn't hopeful of success that day either. I had proceeded a short distance, less than a half mile and one hour elapsed, when I became aware of a sound that captured my interest. It was the sound of wood on wood striking. Upon hearing the noise, I paused to evaluate its possible origin. It seemed to be between 200-300 yards distant. I at first thought of somebody chopping wood. There is an unimproved road that travels the approximate route I had taken. However, that road starts where I was camped and nobody had been by in a couple of days. Also the sound was in groups of 3 or more whacks. As fast as you or I can say aloud, ""whack, whack, whack"", is as fast as the sounds were materializing. I deduced that to rule out chopping wood with an ax, as someone using an ax typically takes a full backswing and then must extract the ax from the piece. Both of those acts take too much time to explain these sounds. Later, my dad said he thought it must have been forest grouse. I tentatively took this for the truth until I myself heard forest grouse a few years later and the sounds were not the same. The sounds continued, never varying direction, but always staying ahead of me as I walked, though I was catching up. Finally, I reached a place where the sounds were no more than 50 yards distant, though the maker remained hidden by a rise on the opposite side of the intermittent creek I was overlooking. I sat down on a log to plan my next move and the sounds continued. There was just something so unusual about them that I was becoming very uneasy. I decided, in spite of the .300 Winchester magnum in my hands, to retreat to F.S. 16 and return to camp. I was so shaken by what I had heard that I stayed in the camper the rest of the day to await my friend's return late that night. Later in the afternoon and into the night, I repeatedly heard a noise like a vehicle crossing a cattle guard at low speed (20mph). It was a low rumbling sound. Indeed, there is a cattle guard on F.S. 16 that can be heard from the camp site and initially this is what I thought I was hearing. What is noteworthy is that this sound was not coming from vehicles on the road. I could also easily hear and see trucks on F.S. 16 and few occurrences of this noise could be attributed to passing vehicles. These noises continued into the night until I went to bed. My friend returned and the rest of the trip came off without incident. For years, I tentatively assumed that what I heard had a generally recognized origin. In June of 1995, an interest feature on Bigfoot in the Oregonian newspaper described ""tree whacking"" as a communication medium of Bigfoot creatures. At that point, I was quite certain of what I had heard.",below the Tower Point Fire Lookout (potentially now Foley Butte Lookout Tower)  near the intersection of F.D. 16 and F.S. 1750 in Ochoco National Forest,Prineville,Hwy 380,Ochoco National Forest,44.5244788,-120.7858436,1659.6,5448,1100,40,overcast,waxing crescent,29,"forest , mountains , stream","fir trees , ponderosa pine trees , mountain mahogany , juniper , sage",NA,NA,NA,45.72,150.0,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,groups of 3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"The witness defined the locations of his camp, the cattle guard and his position in the forest with precision on Topozone.

BFRO,Oregon,Curry,661,NA,1969,August,24,Summer,B,vocalization,animal,"In 1969 at the end of August four other boys and myself went camping near Babyfoot lake in the Kalmiopsis wilderness area in south coastal Oregon. I was 16. At around 11 PM, three of us were asleep and two were up. Even though we were within the wilderness area, we had parked our car some ways down a very hard to negotiate road by a stream bed and had ascended a small hill where there was a campground with easy water access a little further up the stream. One boy, George, went down the hill to get something out of the car, and as he approached the car something which had been hanging out near it took off and ran downstream. It was so loud that Matt, the other wakeful boy, heard it too, and they said it sounded like a jeep going through the brush without a motor. But the real fun started about two hours later, when horrible screams started to be heard from a distance. The sounds eventually woke all of us up, and I must say there were of an incredibly scary nature, not cats or anything even like that. More like metal ripping in a factory. Eventually it became obvious that the creature was making its way towards our camp by the stream, and, machetes in hand in the case of two boys, we all hid deep in our sleeping bags. Well, the camp spent about a half hour estimated under siege by something walking around it on two feet, and continuing to let out these massive wails while us boys shivered in our sleeping bags in utter terror. Finally, the creature started to move away, and as it did, two or three of us looked carefully out to see a huge hulking form moving away in the minor moonlight. This is absolutely a true story, whatever this creature was, its ""wail"" could raise the dead. George and Matt were the totally skeptical types, and the experience shook them tremendously.

BFRO,Oregon,Curry,13729,NA,1974,November,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"My brother, myself, and two other men were working at a cable logging site decking logs on Forest Service land N.N.E. of Brookings, OR. My brother (riggin' slinger) and one of the other fellows (hook tender) were working in the rigging. Myself (chaser) and the other fellow (yarder engineer) were working the landing. Communications between the landing and brush were via hand held walkie talkie. The guys in the brush spotted something moving across a prairie about 2500 ft. across the canyon from the yarder. They thought it might have been an elk but weren't sure. After telling the yarder engineer about it and asking what he thought it was, the engineer had me get a rifle w/scope out of the crummy so as to have a better look. Both the yarder engineer and I took turns looking at this creature through the rifle scope for approx. 15 minutes. We both came to the conclusion that the creature was not a bear, elk, deer or any of the commonly known big game animals that habit these woods around here. The creature was definitely walking upright and on two legs. It had broad shoulders, reddish brown coloured hair, and didn't seem to be in a big hurry gettin to where it was goin. I could see it's arms swinging as it walked and seemed to have a pointed or conical shaped head. I could't distinguish the facial features as it was just too far away. The creature was headed in a E.N.E. direction from us quartering up the hill across the prairie towards the ridge of the hill. We watched the creature until it disappeared over the ridge it was headed towards. On our way home after work we debated what the creature was and concluded that it was a bigfoot. The boys in the brush said that they had the feeling that they were being watched for a couple of days and the hook tender mentioned that he had heard noises like sticks breaking and something walking in the brush while he was working at his duties in the back end of the unit.

Fahrenbach,1973-1975,NA,NA,Fall,B,footprint,NA,"In the lower Rogue River canyon, about 10 miles above Agness, Oregon, I found some odd tracks while on an outing with my great grandfather. The plan was to pick huckleberries and fly fish for steelhead. I was about 10-12 and got bored picking berries real fast. I was old enough grandpa would let me row the boat alone but not use the motor so I went back to the boat and rowed as far up as I could 'til the current got too strong, beached it, and hiked a couple hundred yards up the bank through a big boulder pile at the bottom of a steep clay bank. Between the bottom of the clay and edge of the water was a rock shelf with the boulders lying on it, about 20-30 feet wide. The river had dropped overnight and there was a layer of mud about an inch, maybe 1.5 inches thick on the rock shelf. Just below the pocket I was going to fish I noticed a set of large tracks coming out of the water, crossing that ledge, and heading up the clay bank. Back then, the minimum size limit was 8"" for trout and we all had notches cut 8"" up in the cork in our rod butts as a guage to know which fish were legal. Using that, I guestimated the tracks at 24-1/2"" long and 8-1/2"" wide. I didn't measure the heel, but the foot didn't taper as quickly as a human foot. I guestimated the stride at 6-1/2 feet using the 8-1/2 foot length of the rod. The stride didn't appear to shorten as it went up the bank, it just went up. I don't think I could have climbed that bank without a rope, it wasn't vertical, just very darn steep. There was no sign of whatever it was using the short shrubbery to boost itself along, either. Whatever it was, was very strong and very very surefooted.

I take professional photos for a website I operate and was hoping to get in some great scenic shots before it got to cold and lousy for the rest of the year. My fiance and I were on a hike about six or eight miles above Brookings Oregon, in Curry county. We were on a hiking trail in a densely wooded area following a trail called the loop trail. This trail is about a quarter of a mile past the area called Natural Bridges viewpoint. We had gone down the trail without incident, although it was getting dark and I felt as though we needed to hurry to get back, even though there was no reason to. It was just a feeling like the hairs on the back of my neck had started to stand up. I can't quite explain it, I just suddenly felt uncomfortable. We did not see any other hikers while we were on our way back up the trail, or on the way down. We stopped walking when we heard some loud snaps in the forest around us, like something was breaking tree branches. We looked around, but did not see anything at first. We decided to keep walking, when we saw some bushes about twenty yards ahead of us sway back and forth. We stopped again and were then assaulted by a horrific smell that reminded me of garbage baking in the sun. By then, the nervous feeling I had had intensified and I was really beginning to worry about the onset of fog and the fading light. The forest was misty and it was raining lightly. We were climbing a steep part of the trail and I gave it my best push to get to the end of the trail. As we were finishing the final climb, I turned and looked behind me. I'm not sure why. It was like I knew someone was watching and yet I told myself I was just being silly. When I turned, I saw a head above some tree branches with the rest of the body obscured by the heavy vegetation. The head was covered in Dark, reddish brown fur and was impossibly far from the ground. If this was a man he must have been at least close to eight feet tall. I blinked a couple times convinced I was seeing things. The thing I was looking at did not disappear. Instead it looked at me curiously for a few seconds and then moved out of my view behind a tree. I grabbed my fiance's hand, too afraid to tell him what I had seen because I thought he might go looking for it and then made my way back to our vehicle as fast as I could. I am not crazy. This was not a trick of light or fog. Something very large with the face of an ape was looking at me.

She went on to tell me about her trip to Oregon and how she grew up in the region and loved hiking in the area near the coast. During a hike in the late afternoon she and her fiancée began to hear what she said sounded like ""good sized trees being broken at ground level."" She described this sound as incredibly loud in the relatively serene surroundings of the hiking trail. She said that her initial feeling was that the sound was created by a bear, and began to urge her partner to start heading back to the trailhead as it was getting close to dusk, there was a light drizzle, and the air was starting to get a chill. She said that all the while she felt uncomfortable, as if ""someone were watching her."" She also stated that there was a smell of ""sour coffee grounds"" or ""rotten garbage"" in the air. As they headed down the trail she noticed that wildlife sounds in the area all at once became silent. This was particularly curious to her as well as her fiancée, so they hastened their pace in a steep part of the trail only to hear more very loud ""breaking trees"" again thinking they were in the presence of a bear. At this point she caught movement out of the corner of her right eye and looked around where she saw from a distance of about 25 feet a very large figure, obscured from the chest down peering over a tree branch at her. She gaped in disbelief for about 3 seconds and grabbed her partner's hand. By the time she turned to look again, the figure was gone. Her fiancée was seemingly unaware and later reported that he did not see the subject. While the glimpse was relatively quick, she said it felt like ""moments"" because of the unusual nature of the eight-foot figure. She described the face as that of a ""person"" but ""twice as big"" with a long, reddish-brown receding hairline and light brown, human-like facial skin. She said that the nose was proportionally long compared to the rest of the face, and rounded with wide nostrils. The large, dark eyes were greenish in color, with no whites visible, just irises. She said that the subject's very muscular (""bulging"") right shoulder connected to its head at the jawbone, with no real sense of neck at all, and that the chest was ""as wide as a person is tall."" She described the most fascinating aspect of the incident was the complexity of the subject's expression. She detected genuine curiosity emanating from the figure's face as if it could not help but reveal itself to her because of that curiosity. As the couple rapidly descended to the trailhead they discussed what they had just heard and what she had seen, and neither had any tangible explanation. The witness went on to express how this event had changed her assessment of wildlife and the outdoors and instilled a new fear of hiking and camping. I found this witness to be extremely credible.

BFRO,Oregon,Deschutes,7785,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1963,NA,NA,Summer,B,footprint,NA,"I have been reading your site for the last couple of years, and thought I'd share some experiences I've had over the years. Nothing particularly groundbreaking, but it may add to your database. I have been interested in Sasquatch/Bigfoot since I was a small boy growing up in Central Oregon hearing stories from my uncles and their friends about the goings on in Northern California in the 50s' and 60s'. While there was a lot of skepticism about the possibility of such a creature existing, there was also an underlying acceptance of the possibility that it could exist. My family, and most of the people I knew, spent a lot of time in the woods hunting, fishing, and camping. My grandfather and uncle were expert hunters and woodsmen, and taught me those skills from the time I could walk. In the first 20 years of my life, most of my free time was spent hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, and exploring the wild areas around my hometown. In 1963, my grandfather, mother, brother, and I hiked in to Teddy Lakes in the Three Sisters Wilderness area to go fishing. In those days the Forest Service kept a wooden rowboat at the lake for people to use. We took the boat out and fished for awhile and decided to explore the far end of the lake. There is a small cove at that end of the lake with an island at the mouth of the cove. The cove itself is shallow and swampy. As we rowed around the island we could hear splashing on the other side, and thought maybe had disturbed a bear or an elk. When we rounded the island, the animal was gone, but the ripples in the water were still evident. We took the boat over to the shallows to examine the tracks the animal had left to determine what it was. Most of the area between the island and the shore was maybe 5 or 6 feet deep up to within about 50 feet of the shore where there was about a foot of water over soft mud. What we saw has stuck in my mind for the rest of my life. There was a clear line of tracks where the animal had emerged from the deeper water and walked through the shallows leaving very deep tracks on the mud. It looked like the tracks of a very large man, only wider, longer, and deeper. It was clearly the trail of a two legged creature taking large steps leaving about a 15"" track very deep in the mud. My grandfather and I pondered those tracks for a long time trying to come up with an explanation for what made them. All I can say for absolute certainty is that it was not a bear, elk, or any other animal known to live in the area. We tried to follow the animal into the woods, but lost the trail in the deep forest litter. The reason those tracks have stuck in my mind for so long are two fold. While I was only 9 years old at the time, I had spent several years learning the tracks of the animals in the area, and felt very confident in my ability to identify the maker of the track, when it was made, where the animal was going, etc. I had absolutely no idea what made that track. My grandfather, who was an absolute expert hunter and tracker also could not identify those tracks. We had many discussions over the years as to what that animal was, and never did come up with a plausible explanation. As I have learned more about the Sasquatch from reading books over the years, I have come to think it might have been our elusive furry friend. Another important point is that before rowing over to the island, we had been fishing in the lake for an hour or so talking most of the time. This is a small lake, and any wild animal would have heard us and left the area well before we rowed to the island. The tracks were made by a very large animal. The large animals known to exist in the area are bear, elk, cougar, and deer. All of those animals flee at the first hint of people. It is true that cougars will occasionally observe people from concealment, but I have never known one to swim out to an islad to watch people fishing in a boat. Whatever the animal was, it was watching us from the island and only left when we approached. We didn't smell or hear anything other than the sounds of the animal moving through the water as it went through the shallows. Another incident happened in 1970 or 71 while bowhunting for deer in the Swampy Lakes area West of Bend. I had driven to Tumalo Falls and walked from there in the general direction of Swampy Lakes. I had been out since before dawn hunting and just hiking around, and had stopped around noon to have some lunch and rest. It was a sunny day, with the sound of the wind in the pine trees, and an occasional bird calling. I was having a nice time soaking it all in and thinking about where I was going to go that afternoon. All of a sudden, I got this overwhelming feeling of being watched, and became very anxious. I am not one to become overly excited especially when in the woods. I am very comfortable in the wilds, and had spent countless days in situations just like that day. It is in fact where I feel most comfortable and at home. Anyway, I could not figure out why I was feeling nervous, and began scanning the area carfully to see if I could spot an animal. I didn't see anything, and had just about got myself calmed down when I heard a twig snap in some dense jackpines maybe 60 feet from me. There was something walking in there and it definitely had my full attention. I was now standing with an arrow nocked in my bow trying to see what was in there. Whatever it was stayed out of sight, and didn't make any more noise. I stood there for about 5 very long minutes trying to decide what to do next. I was feeling a little silly about being so scared, and decided to investigate. So I walked around the thicket where the noise came from thinking I could see better from the other side. I didn't go more than a few steps when there was a snap from a branch breaking inside the thicket. It was loud enough that I knew it was a large animal. It was all I could do to keep myself from taking off at a dead run. I was an hour or two from the nearest trail, and maybe another hour from my car. I knew that I couldn't outrun any animal that was making the noise. The fact that I was so scared was what was confusing me the most. It made no sense to me. I have had bears come into my camp at night, and not had anything approaching the overwhelming fear that I experienced that day. I really didn't have any fear of mountain lions or the back bears in the area. We didn't view them as dangerous at the time. Besides, mountain lions don't make noise. You are never going to hear a mountain lion walking throug the woods. They don't snap branches. Bears can be noisy when they are eating and haven't detected you. All of the bears that I had come upon at that time had run as soon as they saw me. This animal was observing me from cover and knew I was aware it was there. I decided that exiting the area was the best call. I gathered my things in my pack and deliberately walked away, keeping a close watch over my shoulder. I did not want to appear panicked and encourage whatever was in there to persue me. I had the distinct feeling that I was being followed from a close distance, and would hear a occasional sound of something moving through the woods. I would turn around to face whatever it was, but never saw anything. This went on for a good hour or so, and then stopped. I walked the rest of the way to the car and drove home. This is the first time I have recounted this experience. The reason I bring it up at all is that other people seem to have had similar experiences. In 1973 a close friend of mine came by my house after a deer hunting trip. He told me that he had seen a big foot while hunting that day. I asked him what he saw and he told me that while sitting by a log at the edge of a clearing, a large hair covered animal 6 or 7 feet tall walked across the clearing in broad daylight about 50 yards in front of him. He told me he shot the animal with his 30-06, it let out a scream and ran into the woods. I grilled him for awhile about the details of the encounter, and I believed he was telling the truth. This happened in the area of Wickiup reservoir south of Bend Oregon. I was very angry with him for shooting the animal, and he wouldn't speak to me about it for a long time after that. I have lost touch with him, but I know some people who may know where he is if you want to follow up. About a year after that incident, another man told me he had an encounter near Three Creeks Lake Northwest of Bend. He and another man were sitting on the tailgate of their pick up after a day's deer hunting, waiting for a third man to return. It was after dusk. They said that they smell a foul odor, and something shook the bushes and threw branches and stones at them. At the time, I didn't pay much attention to this story, but it does seem consistent with some of the behaviors described in John Bindernagel's book. The last incident happened at Fish Lake near Bluff Creek in September of 2002. I had been on a solo backpacking trip from Elk Meadows to the Dillon Divide area, and was spending my last night at the lake before leaving the area the next day. I hadn't seen any sign of Bigfoot, but had a great trip exploring some beautiful country. It was about 11 at night, and I was about half asleep in my tent. I heard a very loud whoop that sounded like it came from directly across the lake. The sound went from low to high, and lasted a couple of seconds. What was striking was the volume. It was louder than an elk bugling.

BFRO,Oregon,Deschutes,7658,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1976,NA,NA,Spring,B,footprint,NA,"This is a very belated report. The early spring of 1976 I was living in a small log cabin on the banks of Tumalo Creek approx 10 miles into the foothills of the Central Oregon Cascades outside of Bend, Oregon. I took my water out of the creek and had an outhouse. One day I was hiking cross-country up the hillside up from my cabin when I came upon some extremely large, flat-footed footprints in the soft dirt of the Ponderosa Pine forest. They were exactly like the ones I have since seen on your website. There was a logging road that switched- backed up the hillside. Other than occasional logging trucks, no one else used that road except for occasional hunters in the fall. I was very surprised, to say the least. I had never heard any mention of Bigfoot sightings in that region before that but went to the library and found out indeed there had been some. It struck me that it was very unlikely to be a hoax as no one would expect anyone to be out walking in that area, so an unlikely place to place bogus footprints. The footprints were coming up the hillside from the area of my cabin and at first it frightened me to think I was sharing an environment with such a powerful creature. As I read about them I realized that it posed me and my infant son no harm and also I felt special to think that there is a good possibility that it had had probably observed us even though I never saw it.",a cabin halfway before the end of the road to Tumalo Falls on a road to the right that corsses Tumalo Creek,Bend,Skyliner Road,Tumalo Falls,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,warm,NA,NA,NA,"forest , creek",ponderosa pine trees,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=7658
BFRO,Oregon,Deschutes,37044,Megan Turnidge,1978,August,NA,Summer,A,animal,NA,"1978 I was 17 yrs old and lived in a remote part of Oregon High Cascades. (Crescent Lake junction). It was a late August day. And I had decided to do some creek fishing. I went thru some private property where Marsh creek and Crescent creek meet. I started hiking up Marsh creek and had gone thru several larger Alpine clearings with the feeling that something was watching me. There was lots of wildlife, cows and horses about so I didn't worry too much about it. After crossing the last fence line and now deep into the Deschutes National Forest I started fishing. Picture a 50 yrd clear swath where no trees grow. Up next to the creek the bank line is lined with willow type bushes and makes it impossible to have a clear view up the creek. So many times I had to hike over to the tree line to continue up the creek. At one point, about a 1/2 mile from the fence line, I had hiked to the trees to make the next clearing at the creek to fish. Being volcanic ground (pumice) I would fish from several feet away then slowly work my way to the creek side. I had fished this particular spot for about 10 mts. by the time I made the creek side. I looked up at the treeline across the creek (25 yards). At that point I realized I had just walked up to Bigfoot. He was rested against a lightning strike stump that was 5 ft. high, his butt sitting down just a bit, and looking over his right shoulder he was watching my every move. We made eye contact looking at each other staring. I could see the full length of his arms, the size of his entire body. The color of his hair covered body. His facial features almost sad looking, more human than gorilla. More expression than you could ever imagine. I broke my rod down without reeling in the line and began to move away as fast as I could, watching him the entire time completely afraid for my life. He, just as startled, stood up from the 5 foot high stump he was resting his butt against, and began to run away from me up the creek as I ran down the creek. His arm length was to his knees, his height at 8 or better ft tall. The speed in which he was able to run from me was incredible. Needless to say he was afraid of me as I was of him (thank God). I've spent my entire life hunting and fishing back country and have never again seen anything like this. Thia was a real life sighting of BIGFOOT in the daylight, no obstruction from 25 yrds. There had been several other sightings and other people that had even closer daylight experiences then myself in the Crescent Lake junction area.",Crescent Lake Juncctin of the Oregon High Cascades,Crescent Lake Junction,Hwy 58,Deschutes National Forest,NA,NA,NA,NA,1400,NA,NA,NA,NA,"forest , creek",pine trees,NA,NA,0.1666666667,22.86,75.0,25,yes,1,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,475,NA,NA,dark,5.5,dark,NA,NA,NA,yes,flat,startled,knees,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,"long forehead , prominent brow ridge",NA,resting by stump,yes,stood up then ran away,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"After speaking with the witness I was struck by the honesty I could hear in his voice. The witness describes the subject as being about 8ft tall and most likely weighing in around 450-500 pounds. He describes its hair as dark, coarse in appearance and frizzy. The hair seemed to be 2-3inches over his body with the belly and legs having slightly shorter hair and the shoulders and head having longer hair, more likely 6-8 inches. The hair was not well kept, but rather matted. The witness also described his face as being ape-like, with a flat nose and dark calloused cheek skin with hair beginning again below the cheeks. The subject had a rather long forehead and prominent brow ridge. The witness stated that he would liken the subject to being maybe one step off the evolutionary chain from humans to apes. The subject had uncharacteristically long arms compared to a human and definite fingers as opposed to paws. This was definitely not a bear. A bad smell did seem to emanate from the subject, it was more comparable to the way a bear smells. Not an overwhelming smell but, also not a pleasant one. The area that the subject was seen in was a densely bushed creek side while sitting against a lightning strike stump. The witness believes that the creature had been watching him working his way up the creek the entire time, but only decided to leave after the witness noticed him. There were no vocalizations made by the subject either before or after the encounter. The witness and the subject locked eyes for maybe 5-10 seconds before they both decided to leave, in opposite directions. The witness did notice the subject's gait as it left, and noted that he was bent forward as if bearing a significant weight. The witness did not return to the area to look for hair or prints due to being a little shocked by the whole encounter and undoubtedly uneasy about it.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=37044
BFRO,Oregon,Deschutes,667,NA,1980,NA,NA,Summer,A,animal,NA,"The thing that canvinced me to come forward with this information after all this time is that what I saw was light colored. Any one I told about it at the times made fun of me because they said they were all black. It was at night in the summer of 1980. My husband was a farm worker and got off work very late. The grocery store would stay open all night so once a month we went into the grocery store when he got off work. We were comming back from the store heading home and the three kids were asleep in the back seat and my husband was dosing off in the passinger seat. Because there had been so many deer out that year I was driving rather slowley incase one ran out in front of me. I saw what I thought at first was a deer come from the brush and trees on the left side of the road. I slowed way down for it to cross in fromt of me. It was not a deer though, it was a very large light redish brown very hairy man. When the car lights hit his eyes it made him blinded like it dose deer and he stopped in front of me and shielded his eyes. His eyes did not shine red, like the wild animals eyes do. His skin was a light brown or tan and he had like freckling on his hands and exposed areas around his eyes. I know he was male because I could see his male parts in the lights from the car. He was right there looking face to face with me. I stopped the car completely because I was afraid I would hit him. He got his berrings and turned a walked off the road. He did have a neck, but it was very short, the muscles in the top of his arms and shoulders were built up like a weight lifters and with the hair gave him the apearance of being humped built. I could see him through his hair, because the lights were shining right through it. I had what we called running lights on the car for me when I drove at night because I have trouble driving in the very dark nights so he was light up like a christmas tree. He was young and in good shape wih well developed muscles. Tall enough that his male parts were above the level of the ford hood when he reached his arms up. He also had a smell about him, a very strong smell. Like a man who has been hitchiking for a few weeks and a dog mixed together. The smell stayed in the car for a while. I had the road vents open. i also remember that he had head hair that was long that hung over his body hair and what seemed like beard hair on his face that started up under his eyes and covered his nose and left out only his mouth. His teeth were brown, his nose full and wide and his mouth had like full lips with the hair growing up over them. I have had other distance sitings in the Oregon woods, as when I was young I spent a lot of time there, but this was my only face to face. I just sat there in a amazement after he was gone.

BFRO,Oregon,Deschutes,63779,Kevin Llewellyn,1982,September,NA,Fall,B,activity,vocalization,"I lived in Tumalo Oregon in 1982 and made a deal with my landlord to pay off some rent by providing him with long fence poles to line his nearby property with. I worked nearby on a horse ranch and rode extensively into the Deschutes National Forest on extended rides to the end of old logging roads into small valleys, toward the Three Sisters Mountains. Once I remember my bounding cow dog running from my front and staying behind my horse. A few minutes later the horse was alerted to something in the distance and refused to go any further. It was in this direction I drove the Chevy truck toward where I could cut down some long, straight narrow poles to pay off my rent. I drove up a narrow road that ended with a loop around a big Douglas fir. The valley was steep to both sides with steady elevation increases to the west toward the Cascade Mountains. I had a hand tree saw and an ax, and I started to cut down, clean up, and drag several pole trees toward the road/truck. About 15-20 minutes later I started to hear faint crackling from the ridge above to my south, like a large deer or elk was walking about. As I continued to work the sounds became louder, more frequent, and generally closer. I could not see what it was but thought it might be a bear. Forest was not that thick but I could only hear the crunching of something coming closer and making its presence known. I had no permit to cut the trees, and whatever was seemed kept getting louder and closer (I could hear snapping dry limbs), so I decided to leave.A few days later I enlisted a friend to go with me to get the poles I had cut. I told him of what I had experienced and he thought I was full of it. I brought a .22 rifle. Upon arriving we proceeded to load up the poles I had left and cut some more. The same thing happened. In about 20 minutes something slowly and methodically came crackling down from the south ridge toward us. At first my friend thought I was pulling a prank on him, that I had enlisted a friend to scare him. As it became apparent this was not the case the 'thing' was within maybe 100 yards of us, behind some old dead trees. It broke more limbs, and we migrated to the pickup, which was parked just before the end of the road and the large Douglas Fir. We sat in silence. Nothing. A few minutes later the noises were back, coming from the woods behind the large Fir. I drove to within maybe 50 feet of the Tree. Embolden with my friend, the truck, and the 22, I opened the door and took maybe two steps toward the tree. Something was behind the tree, and it made an extremely loud noise that when into our core. My best remembrance of it was like a cross between a bear and a lion with a megaphone. I have never experienced anything like it since. Pure fear. I bolted back on the truck, we backed up, turned around and left as fast as we could. I left the ax, bow saw, and some unloaded poles. We didn't tell anyone because I wasn't supposed to be up their in the first place and had no wood cutting permit. Whatever it was, although extremely close, never showed itself.

A friend and I were fishing from a boat on the Deschutes River above Pringle Falls near LaPine Oregon. We were floating down stream very slowly around 10:30 am. It was a very nice sunny day and very peaceful. You really couldn't ask for a better day. As we were floating slowly downstream, we were heading toward a big dirt bank where the river did a 90 degree turn. I remember picking up the stringer of fish to show my friend. I was talking to him about our nice fish when something out of nowhere yelled at us. It was terrible sounding! Never in my life had I heard something like this. It started at a low howl and went up about two to three octaves and then back down again. It was so loud! I am sure you could have heard it a mile upstream. It also lasted a long time (maybe 10 seconds). It sounded more like a person than an animal, but it didn't sound like a person, either. I believe that it came from the top of the 30 foot tall mud bank we were heading towards. The dirt bank was around 100 yards away. We decided to investigate and found nothing. The ground was nothing but pine needles so it would be hard to make a footprint. We were right where we thought we heard this thing. But we saw nothing. I wish I could say I did see something but I can't. What makes this episode strange is that I talked to another friend of mine and told him about what happend. I tried to give him a demonstration of what the thing sounded like. He looked at me and said that I heard bigfoot. Now I thought he was kidding but he said that he had a recording of one. He also told me that his uncle was one of the big Bigfoot explorers. His uncle even made a movie about them. This was news to me. He found this recording on a old record that he had and let me borrow it. What I heard on the record sounded exactly like what I heard. I mean exactly! I later found this recording on the internet and it is called ""Howl"". That is what I heard.

Anyway, I first noticed the bus coming towards me from about 3/4 a mile away. By the time it was a 1/4 a mile away a black figure of pretty good size popped out from behind the moving bus. It appeared as if it was hiding in the ditch. I don't know why it made the decision to suddenly pop out after the bus, but it did. It seemingly was in a run to get to the forest. We lived less than a mile from the national forest boundary. It ran through a small, vague valley that was in front of me. Sagebrush and the odd rock was in this little valley. The figure I saw was entirely black. It could have been for the lack of light. I also must note that this thing was running fast. If it was a man they must have been running like crazy which is not easy through the maze of sagebrush. I couldn't see any detail which limits my conclusion on this experience. But what I do know is that I never witnessed joggers or sprint runners ever in my neighborhood. And where this being ran there was no trail, no path it was following. It was barren property. Why would a runner be doing this at 6am in the morning in the middle of sagebrush and rocks? Doesn't make sense!

This road is narrow, sandy, and winds out through the 10' tall manzanita brush.

He remarked that there was no smell, something commonly, though not always, associated with sasquatch encounters. Being followed by one is by not very unusual, nor is being screamed at.

We would drive down these roads and find a promissing spot get out and walk the area. there are a lot of old fire areas and we found one we had not been to before it was a burnt out section of forest approx 1500 acres in size located about 2-3 miles from the base of Paulina Peek & newberry crater & about 1 mile in from hwy 31 and about 1 mile in from a dirt powerline road and on the south west section of the fire. The burned area was very wide open and we were nere some small rock outcrops, there was a catline road around the fire and this is what we parked on. It was approxametly 1:00 and we had no luck so we decided to try one last place and then go home for the day, which is where i have described. We parked and got out quietly and I headed into the woods on the other side of the road, I walked about100 feet in and was startled by a dow jumping out of the brush and fleeing. We decided to go in the direction that the dow had gone thinking that there may be a buck somewhere nearby, my brother in law went off in the direction he thought the dow had gone and I stayed back and looked for tracks to see if there was others. This is when i noticed some very strange prints on the ground, they were like a humans foot print but larger there were about 8 to 12 prints by one creature as far as i could tell the prints were not all in one dorection. It looked as if the creature, animal, or what ever may have shifted its weight or something when it turned because the dirt was pushed up more on the out side of the print in places. I told my partner and he didn't seem to interested he just kept looking for the deer, then he finally came back up over the little rise and I showed him the tracks he didn't seem to know what to think. I kept studying them and tried to come up with an answer for them, I thought maybe the wind but know the chances of the wind making one let alone 8 - 12 of the prints was very unlikely, or rain but there is no way, or a bear but for a bear to be on its hind legs and to take that many steps was very very unlikely. The prints from what I remember were about 12 to 15 inches in size, and some of the strides were possibly 4 to 4 and a 1/2 feet. We had been at this location for about 30 minutes when my brother in law said we should go he sounded kind of shaky whitch was very unusual for him i asked him why and he said we should go. So this got me kind of spooked for the first during this half hour, so we got in the car and left.

The month was September the weather was warm.My husbane had returned to Redmond to go bowling on his league.I stayed behind as some friends were to come up later that evening and join us The State was doing alot of road work and were blasting parts along the hiway to clear space for wider roads. I was putting more wood on the fire when I Looked at my watch our friends were late as usual.It's was 10:30 a friday. You could heard the trucks and the blasting going on along the road. Then there was this real loud blast! It shook the ground under the stump I was sitting on. futher away from the road you could hear a rock slide started from the blast. Then the woods came to life.I could hear running of a very large animal going through everything in his way.UNDERBRUSH WAS SNAPPING AND SMALL TREES COULD BE HEARD CRASHING TO THE GROUND. As the rocks in the canyon stopped sliding the woods became quite again.Then just across the lake from where my tent was pitched the howing and screaming started.These sounds went on for at lest half hour.I being alone at this time became rather unnerved and decided that my tent would be a better place to wait for my friends from.I crawled inside and found my rifle load a shell into the barrel and sat there in the dark.

BFRO,Oregon,Deschutes,664,NA,1996,November,5,Fall,A,animal,NA,"I was driving home to Bend near sunset, just south of La Pine on US Highway 97, on Nov. 5th, 1996 when a hawk was flushed from the treeline ahead on my right. It flapped vigorously, headed southward directly toward my car, crossed over it and kept going. It was not gliding, it was accelerating. Seconds later, I saw a tall, rangy figure suddenly emerge from the cover of the treeline, about 150 feet ahead on my right, and stride determinedly toward the road across a grassy fringe. As I slowed and closed the distance to within 50 feet, the figure with no hesitation, stopping neither to look in the direction of my approaching car nor to gauge the speed and distance, glided across the two lanes in four strides and kept going directly into the cover of the pines on the other side of the road. I asked my wife if she had seen the 'person' crossing the road. I wanted her opinion of what had transpired before expressing my own suspicions. Unfortunately, she said no - that she had been trying to follow the flight of the hawk behind the car. On immediate reflection, I realized I had seen something unusual but could not say what exactly I had seen. Nor can I say now what it was. But if it was a human being, it was a strange one. The figure seemed not just tall but VERY tall - I would estimate close to 6'8"" to 7' tall (based the figure's height relative to roof of my car). The length of stride required to cross the road in just four strides would be quite large. Its actions did not seem typically human. It did not wait for its chance to cross at the roadside - it waited hidden in the treeline. When its chance came, it never slowed until hidden in the pines on the other side of the road. It didn't even turn toward me, though its efforts indicated it was aware of and concerned by our car's approach. It didn't run or jog as a human might who is caught crossing the road in front of an approaching car. Its step was a well articulated (almost thoughtful) full heel to toe stride with a vigorous push off. It moved briskly with a long swinging arc of the arms, a slightly stiff body-lean with the head and trunk bent forward from the waist. The head was not bent at the neck; I saw no neck; the whole upper torso was bent from the waist. I have thought about the 'clothing'. During the brief seconds, I had seen the figure, the clothing appeared to be completely and uniformly DARK - top to bottom - without distinguishing characteristics. I could not identify the articles of clothing - jacket,jeans, boots, gloves etc. with one exception. The one article of clothing that I might have noted was perhaps a peaked lumberjack's cap with a fuzzy tassle. On reflection, I wonder if it might instead have been the oft-reported pointed head or skull. Please do not put my name or contact information on the public site.

When we stopped to follow fresh bear and elk tracks. We could smell something very bad in the air and thought we were very close to a bear. A large bear. We came across a large stump that had some kind of hair all over it. We studied this for some time trying to figure out what had happened there as the stump had hair all over it and it was also all over the ground. We brought some home with us because it was the strangest fur we had ever felt. This fur was white and very coarse.It was not elk or deer or any fur we knew of. We looked on the ground and notice a set of elk horns that had been dropped We continued down what looked like a game trail and found a wallow. In it were several foot prints from what looked like elk and bear. Also we saw foot prints that were at least 18 inches long and as wide as my foot.(I wear a 6 1/2). shoe.) We followed the tracks and they headed toward a creek. The prints were easy to follow as the ground was clean where they stepped but surrounded with what looked like splashing from wet fur around each print. We investigated further, though I was scared to death, and had noticed the bushes and tree branches had been splashed as well with the muddy water from the wallow. There were tracks every where. What ever made the prints was very heavy. The tracks were deep. My husband who weighs 230 lbs. tried to make prints that deep by jumping next to some and barely dented the ground. My husband, who was a logger and is very familiar with the wilderness had never seen anything like it before and was also astonished. He was curious and wanted to keep investigating but I was so frightened I just wanted to get back in the truck. To the best of our reasoning we figure the tracks were a day old. It had rained on Friday and they had dried enough for us to see them on Sunday afternoon. We usually carry our video camera with us when we go out in the woods but forgot it on this trip. If it doesn’t rain this week my husband is going to go back and film it, he wants to gather more evidence of what is there. I don’t know if I can go back. It may not sound like much in the telling of this story, but in real life you could just feel that something very large and strange lives there and we should not be in this place. This has made such a lasting impression on us both, that we had to come home and tell someone right away.",border of Deschutes and Jefferson Counties,Sisters,Hwy 20,Lake Jefferson,NA,NA,NA,NA,1700,NA,NA,waxing crescent,26,"forest , creek , swamp",pine trees,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,prints went toward a creek,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,18,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,also found hair that turned out to be bear,2,"I did view the videotape that was taken at the scene the following day the tracks were found. Impressive but I knew that I had a better chance at seeing the tracks for myself later that afternoon. Upon arriving on scene, the witness K, filled me in on all the details of what happened before they went off into the forest. I did find other impressions of large tracks that were still part of the original subject. Also, I had the opportunity to compare impressions with bear tracks that were less then a few hours old. Impressions were measured and the bear tracks found were used to identify subject from other known animals in the area. The odd colored hair mentioned in their report was of an elk. It appeared to me to be some type of natural salt lick which was the source of attraction to the stump. I did stay until midnight with witnesses. We walked a couple of roads and they wanted know what the BFRO does while out on expeditions or investigations involving overnight stays. Listed were four witnesses, I had the opportunity to meet K and C, but not the other two. I talked to the third witness T. He was the first to contact me by phone. Each conversation, with T, K, and C matched each other’s story. All witnesses were interviewed separately, either by phone or in person. I did view the cast taken, plaster of paris was the compound used to create the casts. They were unable to get Hydrocal in their area and used what they could before the tracks disappeared. Hair samples were collected in two separate areas where the subject had walked and they were sent off to Dr. Henner Fahrenbach for his expertise on the subject. Will update the report when I receive his final analysis. Sample one was taken from a small sapling, at a height of sixty-four inches. Also present were bear markings or scratches on the tree. Sample Two was taken from another tree, which was laid over onto another tree, at a height of about forty-two inches. It was presumed that subject may have stepped over the sapling. UPDATE Hair samples collected from the area were of a bear, according to Dr. Fahrenbach (7/9/05). Dear Mel, Both samples were bear hair, only the short piece was much more pigmented than the longer one. Keep the hair coming! My best, Henner. Sample one was of a bear. Sample two I was hoping to be our subject. Strand was of a different color and texture and it was stretched, causing it to curl. Thinking is. . . the spring left in the tree as the bear stepped over, snapped it up higher as it passed. Thanks to Dr. Fahrenbach's assistance. Even though the hairs turned out to be of a bear. Tracks found and followed in the area were of a much larger and different subject. END OF REPORT",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=11886

Nobody was out. No campers. They paddled to the back side. To the waterfall….really shallow can totally see the bottom, only 18"" deep if that and can see everything. They saw tracks come in off the west side of bank and walking through, the tracks appeared to be following animal tracks. They veered off and went over to a bird nest, it appeared as if there were broken eggs, the tracks then went off to the east side. They think the current would have wiped them away relatively quickly. Strides were 6 - 8' apart and they believe there were about 200 yards of tracks. Water was freezing. Could see outline of footprint, not clearly defined. Size of tracks were about twice her foot size about 18"" x 7"". She remembers only one set of tracks, her husband believes there could have been two sets as he states stride was about 8' while she said 6' which could indicate two or multiple paths it took. He says there were multiple sized prints, but pretty close in size One of the guys went back the next day and the tracks had washed away. When I went to the site with the couple, I began to appreciate how remote this part of the lake is. It took us about 45 minutes to paddle up the lake channels to get to the head of the lake where a small stream feeds the lake. Kiley and Lynnette showed me approximately where the elk tracks and the unknown tracks came off the bank and meandered up the shallow lake. The possible tracks followed the approximate three elk track ways the entire way except for a couple of instances where it veered off to the east for some reason, then it returned to the elk tracks. Kiley believes he recalls two tracks, one larger than the other. Lynette believes there was only one. Back to the veering off. When the tracks veered off they went over to what appeared to be a birds nest under water. There were what looked like egg shells in these dug outs in the mud. The tracks did go around these mud holes. On the way up the lake I saw white shells along the shore and I considered they could be fresh water mussels, however upon inspection, they were goose eggs or the like in the muddy bank. We saw more in the water as well. We found it odd that they were under water but I did learn the water levels change seasonally and perhaps the year they had come here, the water had been lower in the spring, low enough for goose nests to be in the muddy shores. However I still cannot rule out that something was digging for freshwater mussels, but they have yet to be confirmed at this lake. The other bit of additional information I gathered from them during the second interview on site was that Kylie believes he could make out the toes in the prints, this interests me because the next day, they say their friend could barely distinguish the tracks due to the flow of the river into the lake, they were washing away. To me this indicates the trackway was created the same day and perhaps very recent to their arrival. We paddled further up stream to a waterfall and there is a horse trail that we believe comes from Quinn Meadow horse camp. We will be camping along the shores of this lake, perhaps in September to try to recreate the scene. They were not true believers until coming across this trackway. They have considered all options for what could have created these prints and land at the same conclusion I do, Bigfoot tracks.",yes,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=36384

A road takes off directly east of camp crossing Rock Creek and goes east and connects with the next road towards Steamboat Creek.(Ames Creek Rd.) We took off one morning at day-break (about 7am in November) and deceided to park and check out an area we had saw game in before. As we walked up a steep cat road in about three inches of new snow,(it was snowing pretty good) my wife noted some sm. tracks and asked what they were. They looked like coyote or dog. Then we saw some larger tracks that looked like bobcat tracks. A little farther along my wife said,""some one is up here walking bare foot."" We followed the track and it was smoking fresh, the water was just starting to form in the tracks. We came up on and area that this thing had layed in the middle of the road and had left the snow all dirty. I commented that it sure was dirty. Apparently we kicked it out ahead of us ,as the tracks went straight down the hill and crossed the rd. we had came in on. I told the wife it was bear tracks so as not to scare her.(we had 3 shots between all of us) The track smashed down the snow and made ice as it walked. The tracks were about 14 or 15 inches and 4 inches wide at heel. If it was a bear ,he had to have stepped ontop of its ft. paw marks, because all that we saw were the hind feet marks in the snow. I didn't see any clawmarks and the track looked kind of human.

BFRO,Oregon,Douglas,22570,Chris Minniear,1977,NA,NA,Summer,B,vocalization,NA,"The incident occurred while my cousin and I were returning from a hike near our family home. The area we lived in at the time was fairly remote and we lived at the end of an old logging road. We often hiked the forest behind our homes. As we were nearing our home we heard a very unusual ""whoop"" sound coming from the top of the mountain above us. The sound was loud enough it echoed throughout the canyon. It was a sound unlike anything we had ever heard before and caused us to stop in our tracks. We were very familiar with the area and the local wildlife new it was not a coyote or cougar. We waited a very short time and heard the ""whoop"" again. At this point we both broke into a dead run for our home. As we ran for home we continued to hear the ""whoop"". Once we arrived at my home we immediately informed our parents of what we had heard. My mother, who had lived her whole life in the area, told us we probably heard a cougar but went outside with us to listen. After hearing the ""whoop"" herself she called my father out to hear it also. Both adults agreed it was like nothing they ever heard before and I remember telling them it sounded like a monkey or gibbon I had heard once at a zoo. The ""sound"" continued for two nights and my mother called a county trapper to investigate. The trapper investigated the area but did not find anything.",NA,Drain,Laurel Hills Drive,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1707,NA,NA,NA,NA,"forest , mountains",NA,NA,NA,30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"whoop , Snohomish Whoop",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,each whoop was 3-5 seconds with a  10-15 second pause,4,"I spoke over the phone with the witness, a Deputy Fire Marshal who grew up on a family owned, 360-acre dairy ranch just outside of Drain, Oregon. His childhood was spent with his older cousin roaming the countryside around the family property on which his mother has lived since 1930 and continues to with his father. The witness has been a hunter since boyhood and is familiar with the local fauna and the sounds they make. He has heard cougars vocalize and mentioned how rare that is. The witness was watching a show about bigfoot on the History Channel when BFRO.net was mentioned, so he visited the web site. He came across the Snohomish recording which struck a nerve and thought instantly, “That’s IT!” The shiver it sent up his spine prompted him to send in the report. Over the years, he has attempted to describe the vocals he and his family heard that night. He shared a quick, funny anecdote about coming within twenty yards of a grizzly without realizing it until the bear announced itself with a growl and a huff. When his girlfriend asked what had made the noise he said, “ A bear: we got to get out of here.” What he was thinking was, “That’s not IT.” I found it amusing that he had an encounter with a big bear and almost instantly thought of the vocalization from all those years ago. On a summer evening in 1977 the witness (age: 12) and his older cousin (age: 17) were walking home after playing in a hayfield until dusk. The distance between the two is three quarters of a mile. About half way there they were both startled by a loud whooping. They paused to listen and after the second whoop began to run. The quality of the sound, ”made the blood run cold….IT was disturbing…the feeling was instinctual…I’ve never run so fast in my life.” The vocalizing continued until they were inside the house. There they eventually convinced his “incredulous parents” to step outside to listen to the vocals. Until that point the couple had supplied the young men with every possible explanation for the noise...cougar, elk etc. The witness explained to them that it sounded like a gibbon he had both seen on TV’s Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom and heard at the zoo. Once outside, all was quiet. He remembers distinctly his father standing and listening until he said, “I’ve had enough.” Just as he turned to go inside, the whooping began again and continued for some time. “That really disturbed my mother and that isn’t easy; she’s an old farm gal.” She walked inside and while the animal continued to call, an old high school friend and trapper for the county. She told him that “something was out here and he needed to come and check it out.” After the vocals stopped, his cousin wished to go home but did not care to walk, despite the fact that it was only across the road, so he called his parents for a ride. Because they refused, the witness’ father drove the teenager home in his pickup. The two boys did not venture from the farm for weeks following this event. Nothing was found by the trapper who arrived three days later. The vocalizations were five to eight seconds long with a pause of ten to fifteen seconds between them. Those on the first night lasted over a half hour, possibly longer. The witness reports that everyone could easily tell where the sound originated and all four were impressed; no one present had heard anything like it, before or since. “It was not from a small animal.” The vocalizations continued the following two nights lasting up to, or over an hour per episode from the same spot on the mountain near some old growth firs that are no longer there. The witness states, “ I got the impression that it was looking for a response and didn't get one and moved on, or that it was announcing its presence.” I found this witness credible. I believe the vocals’ timbre and volume described are consistent with other alleged sasquatch vocals.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=22570
BFRO,Oregon,Douglas,96,NA,1978,June,NA,Summer,B,animal,NA,"In July of 1978 when I was just 7 years old, I traveled to Oregon with my family to visit relatives. We spent 3 weeks in the state and I was lucky enough to see what I think was Bigfoot. We had camped in an area that was dense and close to a shallow river. It was almost like the camp was a bald spot with a wall of brush and trees around it. There was a trail that led to the shallow river and although it probably wasn't far, seemed so to me. The late afternoon was sunny and warm and everyone but my cousin, my uncle, and myself went to look for herds of elk or antelope. We had campers to sleep in, and my uncle and my cousin were both napping when this sighting occured. I was outside one of the campers playing when I heard a rustling of underbrush.I never smelled anything that I can remember, or heard a sound other than the rustling. When I looked up, I noticed that a small sapling...maybe the size of the end of a baseball bat, just bent completely over.This sapling was behind a thick wall of what appeared to be some sort of a berry bush. I am not sure what kind, though. I was curious and walked over to where I had seen the sapling bend over, thinking that there was a squirrel hanging on to it or something. That is when a large hand reached out from behind this brush and grabbed a handful of berries. I had to be 8 or 10 feet away at the time. The hand was huge with long reddish brown hair. It was clear that it was a hand and NOT a paw. I stood there in total shock.When I managed to run, I ran for my life. It did not chase me or anything, but I saw all that I wanted to see of it. The hand was scary enough, I probably would have died of fright had I seen the rest of it. I got back into camp which was not far away, but far enough for my napping cousin and uncle not to hear anything. I never screamed or made a sound, I just ran and sat as close to that camper as I could. I realized when I sat down in the fine dirt that I had wet my shorts.I was 7 years old and I had never done that before! I kept my mouth shut until my Mother and my other uncles and aunts (That were from Oregon) got back from antelope/elk sightseeing. I told them everything and they told me that it had to have been a bear. I described the color of the hair and I was told that it must have been black hair that I had seen, because this area only had black bears. I wasn't stupid. I knew the difference between a hand and a paw and the difference between reddish brown and black. I managed to let them convince me that it must have been a bear and we left and came back to our home state of Mississippi. A few years later I was in 6th grade. We had a library period and we could look for and check out books. I found a book with a black cover and if I am not mistaken, the title was ""Bigfoot"". I hurried to check this book out and read it from cover to cover. It wasn't until that moment that I figured out that the animal that I had seen those years earlier had a name. I had never been so excited in my life! Ever since, I have been interested in all sightings, shows, books, etc. of the Bigfoot/Sasquatch/Yeti/Skunkape. I have thought about telling my story for years, but I, like everyone else, have been afraid of the teasing and skeptisism of others. My family says ""We believe that YOU believe what you saw."" I will believe it until the day I die. I am 29 now and I hope that the mystery will be solved in my lifetime. My husband and my son believe me more than my Mom, Dad, Aunts, Uncles and cousins. I am very genuine and honest and I would never lie about something like that. I don't know why I was one of the chosen people to have had the opportunity to see even just a tiny part of this mysterious creature.

We did not have a campfire due to the dry conditions. I was sound asleep when I felt something touching my beard. (I had a very heavy beard/mustache and long hair at this time). It was gently rubbing fingers through my beard, not as if it was intending to wake me, only trying to figure out who or what I was. I would liken it to a blind person touching the contours of your face to try and ""see"" you. For some reason I was thinking of a squirrel or other critter. I did noticed an odor like burnt hair and decomposing meat. Very strong. I sat up and roared to spook whatever it was, away. It took off into the heavy brush in an area where it didn't have to cross dirt/gravel. I could hear it crashing through the brush on two legs. It was big and heavy, very noticable.

I was about 15 and my friend & I went hiking in the hills between these two neighboring towns of Sutherlin & Oakland, Oregon. It was in the fall, I believe we were just about to go back to school for the year. It was a pretty warm day. We stopped along the way to take a restroom break. We were on some logging roads, or they may have just been fire control roads put there by the BLM, but anyway we were on a curve in the road. We knew there were probably other people in the area, and so we each posted a 'watch-out' while the other of us did our business. Anyway, I was watching out for her, and walked a little way back down the road the way we had just come... when I heard a noise. I looked up just in time to see what I thought must have been a bear. It was just across a clearing across the road coming down a very steep embankment. It was near the top, very dark brown or black in color and was crashing down the embankment through some smaller trees, in an upright position. I know it was not a man. It did not have clothes on or anything like that. It was big and hairy. it started from the top of the steep embankment and crashed downwards almost in our direction. I could hear the thump thump thump thump of its steps very clearly along with all the crashing of the brush. It was doing this in an upright position taking huge steps as one would if you were walking down a steep hill very quickly. I was stunned for a moment, then I screamed, and it stopped and looked in my direction, I ran... my girlfriend was still around the corner and she screamed too... I was yelling bear! bear! bear! and we both hurried off in the other direction. She asked me what I saw and I told her; we speculated on it for much of the rest of our long hike. I had convinced myself that it must have been a bear. Later that night I told my father about our close call with the bear and when I told him what I had saw and what it did... he told me it must have been a man because bears did not ever walk upright and definitely not upright down a hillside. that is when I came to the conclusion that it must have been a big foot.",BLM land between Sutherlin and Oakland,Sutherlin,6th Ave,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1200,NA,clear,NA,NA,"hills , forest , logging road",Douglas fir trees,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"dark brown , black",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,running down hill,NA,running,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=3295
BFRO,Oregon,Douglas,553,NA,1980,October,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"A TRUE STORY: I left Oklahoma City with my two brothers, Bobby and Jimmy, and a friend named John. We headed for the state of Oregon in August 1979 for a possible long term stay. After a 5-day drive we came to the small town of Drain, Oregon, where Jimmy had been a few years earlier with his ex-wife and child. After about 3 weeks we settled in and everything was looking pretty good for us. A couple of months passed by and one early morning in October 1979 I got up and asked my brother Jimmy if he knew of a place to go deer hunting. He told me that he had been to a place a few years ago just outside a small town called Yoncalla, Oregon, a few miles south of Drain on HWY 99. So we took off to go check out the area he told me about. We drove south of yoncalla about 2-3 miles and turned to the west on an old logging road. We went up the road for about 2 miles and came to a fork in the road, at that time I ask Jimmy, do I go right or left? He told me it doesn't matter. So I turned right and the road ended at the top of a mountain about 2 more miles up. The road that turned left at the fork ended at the top of a mountain about 300-500 yards away to be left. Jimmy and I got out of the car for a nature call, after about 20 seconds Jimmy told me to look over on the other mountain top, he saw something move. I looked and I told him that I didn't see anything. About 10 seconds later Jimmy told me, look I saw something move! I looked and told him that, I.., and that's all I could say. At that time we saw a BIG black thing walking like a man. It walked over to the edge of the other mountain, the mountain we would have been on if we had taken a left at the fork in the road. It was standing there for about 10-20 seconds before it walked back to where we first saw it. When it stopped, it turned and looked at us for about 30 seconds, then turned away. That's when we saw a little one standing there beside it. We watched as they walked away from us over the mountain. They were about 300 to 500 yards away from us; the big one was about 6-7 feet tall and about 300-400 pounds; very muscular. The smaller one was about 4-5 feet tall and probably about 100 to 150 pounds. After we got over the shock, Jimmy and I left and drove down to the fork in the road and saw a man on a horse. We stopped and asked the man if his horse was acting funny or if he saw anything strange? He pulled out a BIG pistol and told us he was not worried about it. I think that the Big Foot was looking at him, when it walked over to the side of the mountain and looked down. We stopped in the town of Yoncalla to get something to drink and told some of the people there and they did not care to talk about it, so we left. I hope you take this story seriously, because you are the first that I've told it to in a long time. I have always wondered why me, why did I see it. Charles A.

Over the years there are several incidents that stand out in my mind, but the one(s) that prompted me to write you occured during my stay in the summer of 1989. Two of my cousins and I were up very late watching some movies. When the movies were over, we decided to go outside and goof around. As we were running out the door, a strange sound stopped us in our tracks. It was coming from the creek bottom and made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. It began to sound as if a cow was beying, a very deep gutteral sound advancing into a howl that lasted about 5-10 seconds. At first I was dismissing it as one of the neighbors cows, but my cousin said she had never heard it before and the end of the vocalization sounded more like a wolf than a cow. I yelled for my younger cousin to come back inside, she had frozen in place when the sound started, and we locked the door - something that they never do because the location is so rural. I had never been so frightened by a noise in my life. What ever it was sounded very large and I was in doubt that the locked door would stop it if it decided to investigate it's surroundings. It sounded very close, but we were located in a valley, and because of the echo it was hard for me to figure out exactly how close it really was. Two nights later I heard it again, this time I was alone on the dirt road that connects the ""highway"" to the properties on the Mountain. I was walking to the bridge that covers a creek that seperates the properties when I heard it again, starting low and growing to a high-pitched howl.

BFRO,Oregon,Douglas,9393,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1991,October,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"I was traveling back to Southern Oregon, from Portland, Oregon in the fall of 1991. It was approximately 2:30 am, on a Saturday morning. I was driving south on Interstate-5 and it was raining lightly. The area is known as Rice Hill, about a half hour north of Roseburg, Oregon. Heading south, the highway runs up rice Hill, sweeps to the west across the top, and then turns back to the south as it drops off. As I crested the hill, and was exiting the the turn to the west, my headlights came level with the road and the guard rail, along the turn to the south. Right at the point of curve, of the turn to the south, right next to the guard rail, was a bigfoot. It was crouched down, kind of squatting, like a baseball catcher, untill my headlights were right on it, and then it stood up, quickly, took a step or two and jumped the guard rail, and went down the enbankment. At 65 mph, I didn't see it for long, especially at night; however, there is no doubt that it was the stereotypical bigfoot. Needless to say, I was quite surprised, and I pulled over. My stopping distance, at that speed, put me downhill from the spot quite a way. I was carrying a .44 magnum pistol with me, and thought about going back up on foot to look for sign, but I was a little rattled at the time, and opted not to. I sat there for probably 5 minutes, and then continued home. I told friends and family, but have never contacted any organization about the incident. The only issue I have with this sighting is that is was within 4 days of Halloween (before or after, I don't remember). That being said, I still don't quite know what to think about it. The bigfoot, as I said, was the stereotypical bigfoot. Dark brown, shaggy, little or no neck, long arms, and stood on two legs. Having seen many bears in the wild, I'm certain it was not a bear. Its ability to jump a guard rail in two steps was not anything a bear could do. It didn't seem huge to me, however, when I stand next to a guard rail, it comes up to the top of my knee (I'm 5'8""), so it must have easily been in the 6'+ range. I never got to see its face, mostly the back and a bit of its left side. All I can say is that it looked like Chewbacca from the back.

BFRO,Oregon,Douglas,22996,Bart Cutino,2002,August,20,Summer,A,animal,footprint,"I was walking in the woods behind my house in Lookingglass, near the Callahan Mountains during the late afternoon/evening. I was enjoying the late summer weather by taking a walk when suddenly I heard something stir in the brush several yards ahead of me. I walked silently for a few yards, daring not to get too close. More rustling. It was moving away now.... and then out of nowhere it appeared ahead of me. I don't think I have ever seen any bipedal thing that tall.... and hairy. Of course I wasn't right next to it... with the animal being about 20 yards away. I was twelve at the time, but I know what I saw. Call me crazy, but when I got to where I first heard the rustling, there was this odiferous smell that I can't put into words. The creature was dark brown, almost black, and hairy, like an ape, but bipedal like a human. Its face and muscular structure resembled an ape, but its upright appearance looked more like a human. I followed the animals' route several days later for about 20 yards after it disappeared and found a faint footprint. It was enough to make out the characteristics. Five toes and I would estimate that it was larger than Shaq's foot by a long shot. I walked along the fence line for a while and I couldn't see any holes. There were some parts of the fence though, that the animal could have just stepped over, being that big (8ft approx).",5 miles from the Lookingglass Store in a logging area off Touchstone Lane,Lookingglass,Flournoy Valley Road,Callahan Mountains,NA,NA,NA,NA,1607,NA,NA,waning crescent,38,"forest , creek , mountains",NA,NA,NA,0.2916666667,18.29,60.0,20,NA,1,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,dark brown,NA,grey,NA,NA,NA,"no , gorilla",NA,sinister,long,round,"yes , short",proportional to height,muscular,stooped,yes,NA,NA,came out of woods onto trail and looked at witness,yes,NA,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,5,NA,NA,NA,1,"I spoke with this young witness, who is now 17 years of age, on February 10, 2008. At the time of the encounter, she had gone for a casual walk late in the day near the base of a small forested mountain just north of her family's property. It was still warm after a hot day in August. She heard rustling around in the brush just ahead and directly to her left. Seconds later, she was stunned to see a very tall, hirsute, dark-colored biped step out into a tiny clearing 20-30 yards in front of her and look at her ""dead in the eyes"" with what she interpreted to be a ""sinister"" type look. The witness took a step back and the creature slowly turned and departed back inside the tree line. She further elaborated on the subject's appearance and described it as looking very ape-like in both its discernable facial characteristics (dark gorilla-like facial skin) and muscular upper body that was ""very buff."" The animal appeared bipedal and human-like, except for being covered in very dark brown, ""almost black"" hair. She also described the subject's head as being average-size in relationship to the body and “round” on a short, almost absent neck. She estimated the animal's height as being close to 8 feet. It stood with a slight slouch; the lower limbs seemed proportional to the subject's size and stature, but the arms appeared ""a little lengthy.” During the 15-20 second encounter, the witness also described a strong, foul-smelling odor that she later concluded was similar to that of a skunk but much stronger. After the subject disappeared inside the tree line, the witness – quite shaken up – retreated towards her residence at a very brisk pace. She was reluctant to return to the location, but did so several days after the encounter. In regards to the faint ""footprint"" mentioned, when the witness returned to the site, she retraced the path the animal took and found an indentation which appeared to have the outline of a single, large and bare footprint with 5 toes. She was not able to find any other track impressions. She believes with its size and estimated stride it could've easily stepped over a nearby fence into thick vegetation along any point of the brush-concealed fence line. Five and a half years later and now a senior in high school, her and her family still reside on the same property. Although she's heard of other bigfoot sightings in the Callahan range, and the towns of Tenmile, Lookingglass and Glide (northeast of Roseburg), she hasn't experienced any other bigfoot activity around the family property. On several occasions she has heard strange, howling vocalizations late at night. She can't be certain these were bigfoot sounds, but they were unusual enough for her to take notice. Note on the region: The Callahan Mountains are a series of small, crag-like forested mountains overlooking the Flournoy Valley west of the town of Roseburg. Due to the diversity in both climate and soil, this scenic southwest Oregon valley is considered historic wine country and is made up of a series of interconnecting small mountain ranges and valleys including both the Klamath & Cascade Mountains, as well as the Coast Range (further west). Although this area is heavily logged with many clear-cuts, there continues to be a consistent history of reported bigfoot sightings by locals in the densely forested sections of the mountains and logging roads. It's also worth noting that coincidentally, several months before this witness' report submission to the BFRO, fellow BFRO researcher Cliff Barackman & myself, while traveling through the state of Oregon, camped within just a few miles of the witness' residence in August of 2007 and spent one uneventful evening there. Interestingly enough, that location was suggested to us by a friendly Oregon Fish & Game Warden we met at a Roseburg service station earlier in the day. He also kindly shared with us several detailed and recent bigfoot encounters he was personally aware of.",NA,yes,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=22996
BFRO,Oregon,Douglas,8227,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,2002,October,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"I was driving home from work a year ago, December. It was about midnight. I was driving on hwy 138 heading east about 15 miles out of Roseburg, Oregon. As I rounded a curve in the road, I saw what I thought was a deer way up ahead crossing the road. I slowed down a bit as I got to where I thought the deer would be. What I saw was a figure standing just off the road by a fence with one hand on the fencepost and it turned as I went by, watching me. I thought It was a man so I stopped to see if he needed help. I got out of my truck with my flashlight in hand and started walking back toward the ""man"". I was working the lightbeam along the fenceline when I heard the most godawful sound I've ever heard in my life! I froze. I was in the military and I work as a psychiatric nurse and I don't scare easily but that scream scared the crap out of me. It sounded like a dying calf in a hail storm..It was ranging in tone, starting out high pitched, then ending up as a threatening, low pitched, guttural sound. I dropped my flashlight and RAN back to my truck and spun tires getting out of there. The next day on my way to work, I stopped at the same spot. My flashlight was still there. I didn't notice any footprints but did see the tall grass had been walked through on the other side of the fence. I looked on all the fence posts in the area where I saw it but did not see any evidence of hair. As to what it looked like, I only got a brief look as I went by, but it had to be at least 7 foot tall. I base this on the fact that I drive a Dodge Ram truck; when I'm sitting in the driver's seat, my head is 6 feet off the ground. The spot where this thing stood is in a depression in the ground. When I park my truck in that spot and stand where it stood, I can't see into the cab at all. And yet, that night I saw it, its head was even with mine, I was looking directly out the window not slightly up or down. I couldn't make out features as it was dark but the lights of my pickup slightly illuminated the area where it stood as I went by. As I said, I thought it was a man at first who needed help. It looked so human at that moment, it wasn't until later that I came to believe it couldn't have been a man. No man could have made that sound. What I remember seeing was a figure standing next to the fence. Its head followed me as I went by. It didn't appear to have shoulders, it looked like the head just spread out until it became shoulders. It appeared to have long hair all over; at first I thought it was a long jacket like a duster, but as I look back it had to be fur. But it was the scream that stands out in my mind. It was like a warning, ""don't come closer"", at least that was the message I got!",south side of Hwy 138 E 15 miles west of Roseburg and 4 miles west of Glide,Glide,Hwy 138 E,North Umpqua River,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,grass,NA,NA,NA,4.57,15.0,5,NA,1,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,standing on side of road with arm on fence post,NA,NA,NA,scream,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,The site of the observation is about a mile south of the North Umpqua River.

I caught three or four glimpses through the burned trees before it went over the ridge. About 10 seconds later I heard two loud screams like before.

We pulled into a forest Service campground named Eagle Rock and found we were the only ones in the campground. The campground is situated right alongside what I believe is the Umpqua River. There are steep mountains on both sides so I guess you would say we were at the bottom of a canyon. The water was running over a lot of rocks next to our site and made a lot of noise. My brother decided to pitch his tent next to the river and I slept in my van in the parking spot. As darkness fell, we sat out in the dark talking about our lives. This was the first time we had been together in about 20 years so we had a lot of stories to tell. While we were was talking,I heard something making a weird calling noise from the mountain across the river from us. I wasn't sure until I heard it a second time. Since my brother was talking at the time, he didn't hear it. We eventually headed off to our respective beds. My brother woke up at 0200. He said he was checking his watch fo the time when he heard 2 loud hoots from across the river about 50-100 yards downstream. He called them hoots but said it wasn't really a hoot. He couldn't really describe or imitate the sound. They had to be very loud to be heard over the noise of the river. He laid frozen in his sleeping bag then heard something walking around the campsite. About that time something woke me up. I heard something moving around outside the van and was about to raise the windowshade to peek out when I heard what sounded like a gorilla grunting next to my van. I have no real experience with gorillas and have only heard them on nature shows on TV, but that's what I heard. Needless to say I was too afraid to lift the shade at that point. After a while, it got quiet (except for the river noise) and somehow we both fell back asleep. When it finally got light we came out, compared notes and started looking for any tracks. The ground was too hard and the river too rocky to show us any. I also checked the campground to see if there were any other campers there, but there were none. We don't think it could have been deer or elk because it was right in the middle of hunting season and hunters are all over the place up there. I don't think any deer or elk would come into a human camp at that time of year. When we got home we listened to the recordings on the site.

BFRO,Oregon,Grant,7562,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1973,November,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"My story is approximately 30 years old and I have never told it to other than friends and family. My wife and I were in, I believe, Union County, Oregon, where I was elk hunting. I hunted alone because too many hunters like to ride all day and I like to walk the high country. I carried a CB radio so I could stay in contact with the wife and kids. After driving to the high country I would have my wife drive back down and I would hunt the ridges and if necessary call and have her move my truck to another location as I hunted my way along the high ridges. On this day it was beautiful, clear cool, and sunny. I had a small breeze coming toward me as I walked along a high ridge. As I came down into a saddle where there were about 3"" diameter saplings on both sides of the ridge, the path in front was clear on top for a long ways and about 30 feet wide. Vision was great. As the ground became level at the bottom of the saddle there was a single pine tree about 9 feet tall in the middle standing by itself. From about thirty, maybe forty feet away, I noticed what appeared to be a tall stump or object standing on the other side of the tree. The saplings on each side of this ridge had leaves still on so you could only see throught them to about three feet up. I still had my rifle slung on my back as stopped to view the dark object on the other side of the lone pine tree. I watched it and decided after a minute or so it was not a deer or elk and decided maybe a old tree stump with the top broken off about 5 feet tall. I then squatted down and was looking under the saplings to see if I could spot any part of an elk through the underside of the saplings. I first looked right and then turned to my left and suddenly I spotted movement from the right corner of my eye and I jerked around, peering back toward the pine tree. I saw the object was gone and as I swung to the right I saw two brown legs to the waist through the saplings running as fluid and fast as any thing I have ever seen. I heard nothing. I immediately ran to my left and down along the side of the saplings and in about a hundred yards the saplings ended and I had a expansive view of the side of the ridge. I was amazed to see nothing. It was as though whatever I saw disapppeared into shale rock slopes down the ridge..with no noise I could detect. I was breathing hard but stopping long enough to listen..still ..nothing. I hunted on out the ridge about another 3 miles and then dropped off the side as evening was approaching. I asked my wife who was on the only road in if she had seen any hunters in the area and she said no hunters or camps. The road dead ends at a fire lookout. I have concluded after thinking about this over the years that what ever I saw was intelligent (it froze until it knew I was looking away). If it had tried to move from behind the tree, I would have been able to see it very clearly. It waited for probably one to two maybe even three minutes while I studied the area without moving. But as soon as I looked off to my extreme left, it ran across the 12' clearing. After swinging to my right still on my haunches, I had a clear view of the legs running to know it was on two legs with brown smooth looking fur. It ran quietly but fast and unbelievably quiet. I'm guessing 5 feet tall; there was no smell as the breeze was in my face while it was directly in front of me. I still don't know about there being a bigfoot but I cannot explain what I know I saw that day. I hunted New York , California and Montana years prior to this and am considered a knowledgeable hunter. I have played this over in my head many times since and I still wonder??.

I was outside talking to my stepbrother who was working on our pick up truck. Well I noticed someone standing atop the hill across the road. At first I thought who was that lady at that time of day?, I assumed at that time because I saw long dark brown reddish hair lit by the setting sun behind her. Then I noticed its entire silhoutte was covered with hair, not just the head. I stared at it for a good minute or so, as it just stood there. I knew then it was a bigfoot that my folks told me about. It turned and started walking away. As it dissappeared I ran into the house and was yelling to everyone what I had just seen. Parents went up top the hill and found large foot prints. That happened late summer in 1976 in Canyon City Oregon. Story 2. I had another experience traveling through the Three Sisters Mountain Range between Bend and Eugene Oregon. It was late that fall about the same year 1976. We were on our way to Eugene,me,my mother, and step brother. I had to take a leak and we were up on the mountain so I asked them to pull over because I couldn't hold it any more and had to go. Well they pulled over and I got out and was in the process of going when I looked down I saw a foot print beside the road, a bare foot, no shoes on. I noticed there were several prints from the road going into the woods. I got scraed ran back to the car and jumped into the front seat of the car. I specifically remember saying lets get the hell outta here I just saw some bigfoot tracks. They wanted to see, so I had to let my mom out, so we looked at them together and found footprints in the sandy dirt roughly the size of a mans. I have been told by my mother, of loud screams that were loud,gutteral sounds, and somewhat raspy. Also in Canyon City. She also described them as being like the creature was in a deep sorrowful pain, as it sounded to her. I also had friend that moved from Michigan that he and his folks seen one standing in the middle of the road one night, described it as a large hair covered creature that looked like a man, he referred to it as a bigfoot. I have another story told to me by my grand mother in Yreka California. She was living in her cabin in the forest when one night she saw a bigfoot peering at her through the window. She said that it must see in the dark because its eyes were lit up like that of a deers in the head lights and that the color of them were blue. She said she was not afraid of it. She also said that its eyes seemed as if they had the knowledge of the all the world in them. It was there only a minute, then it was gone.

It's 14 miles to the Middle Fork of the John Day River and then upstream another25 or so miles on a county road. Then you turn up the Big Creek Road and go another 6 miles. Anyway, that will get you in the area of our encounter. We had gone to bed about 10. I was asleep when my wife woke me up to listen to a strange noise she had been hearing for over an hour or so.Well, I listened for a little while and didn't hear anything and was trying to get back to sleep. All the sudden I heard what she had been hearing. I've been in the woods my whole life hunting, fishing cutting firewood, not to mention the years I've spent hauling logs out of the woods. I'll tell you what that was the strangest sound I had ever heard. Almost like a screaming howl. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. My wife said that it was moving around us, because she had heard it in 4 different spots since the first time she heard it.She said it sounded closer now than the time before. Needless to say, we were both wide awake by this time and then it screamed again and it was in a new spot. Either it moved around or there were more than one. We were just lying there with the window open staring into the dark. It was a little cloudy so not much light out, but we were still trying to see something. All this time our two brave dogs that normally bark at everything were hiding under the table, shaking. No matter what we did they wouldn't move. Then it screamed again and it sounded really close and loud. I got out of bed and grabbed the gun, a. 22 , that almost made me feel worse. Anyway, we loaded up right then. My wife held the gun and flashlight, while I got out of the camper as I'm disabled and then I held the light & pea shooter while she tried to hurry and put every thing inside. To sum up that part, we left. When we got home we went straight to bed in the morning. We found out that one of the dogs was so scared she pooped on herself in the camper. She has never done anything like that before or since. We just kind of didn't talk about it too much until that show came on, Mysterious Encounters. You played a recording of a bigfoot and when we heard it it sent goosebumps over my skin and my hair stood up again and so did my wife's. That's the same sound we had listened to that night.Oh, by the way, it was about 2AM when I first heard it but my wife said she had been listening to it for well over an hour. Well that's it; I can't think of anything else that happened that night but if L. or I remember anything we will let you know.",campsite 300 feet off the road near a rock cliff and creek,Galena,"Big Creek Road , FS #2090",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,100,60,overcast,NA,NA,"forest , spring , creek","pine trees , fir trees",NA,NA,60,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,moving spots while vocalizing,NA,NA,NA,screaming howl,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=10324

Fahrenbach,2003,August,NA,Summer,B,vocalization,NA,"At about 11pm, after sitting silently in front of the campfire for a couple of hours, I all of a sudden started hearing a single, loud wailing sound. It sounded like a cross between a wolf and 'tarzan'. Somewhat human, but definitely not. The high-pitched howl that at first I thought was a wolf, became louder and longer, and was moving slowly through the woods about a quarter mile from me at most. It would stop briefly, then continue, sounded like something in pain or extremely lonely or lost, calling out for others. I heard no other calls in response, and I didn't utter a sound because I didn't want to scare it off. I was mesmerized. It kept sounding off for about 10 minutes, then gone. It was not close enough to hear footsteps associated with it. VERY Loud vocalizations. When I realized that I've heard wolves, coyotes, and cougars before, I knew this was nothing of the sort. That's when my whole body got chills as I realized that I must be hearing a 'Sasquatch'. I can't say I had really ever considered that they exist or not. I was certainly open, but skeptical.

Fahrenbach,2004,September,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"Three strange things in three days: I woke up one morning and went into the trailer to get a cup of coffee and we had two dogs and I let them out and the little dog took off somewhere. I decided to go and look for her. I started walking up the hill right behind the trailer and I got up to a rock face were I could look down on the other side of the hill. I couldn't see anything and I was tired from walking up the hill, so I sat down to have a smoke. I sat there for about five minutes and was looking at the great view. Then I heard the dog bark and I turned my head and looked back and all I saw was a 7-8 foot tall black streak running down the hill. I jumped up and started following it; I couldn't see it but I could here it crashing through the brush. I got down to the bottom of the hill were there was a clearing. When I got down to that clearing, the crashing noise stopped. Then on the second day, I decided to go for a walk early in the morning. I walked to the top of the hill and walked down going north. When I got to the middle of the hill, the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I got goose bumps. I looked behind me and beside me but didn't see anything, so I started walking again. I walked across the top of the hill and then walked through another clearing that would take me back to camp. I walked through the clearing and saw the trailer and my little brother- he was sitting out side - I waved to him and I walked back up over the same hill. I didn't see anything at all but when I got back to camp, my mom, her boyfriend and my little brother said that my little brother saw something orange in color walking on two legs, following me. My mom said she had never seen him that scared before and her boyfriend was out going to the bathroom and when he walked back to camp my little brother saw the top of his head through the trailer window and he had long hair and she said my brother freaked out and said that it was coming to get him. On the third day, after I knew that something was following me, I walked back up the same hill and when got half way up it, I could hear something. I looked up the hill and there were branches of trees about 2-4 inches thick and about 3-4 feet long being thrown down the hill at me.

Cattle were grazing toward the south end of the meadow, and also in the woods to the east, but they were fenced out of the meadow, where I was walking on an old road. I'd gone maybe about 500 ft. and heard, off to the southwest, near the E-W fenceline, in the woods on the other side of the meadow, a really horrible noise. I've worked in the woods on the coast for almost 20 yrs., and have been camping over in the Malheur for about as long, and I have never heard anything like it. It was very loud, like a cow bellowing but it wasn't a cow. It's hard to describe, or even remember exactly, but it was almost like a scream, but not a scream, it almost sounded like something may have been in a lot of pain, or maybe just really mad. It went on for at least a minute or more. I was listening, and a first thought coyote, but it didn't sound like a coyote. I have heard that cougars can scream like a woman, but it didn't sound like that. I was most impressed by how loud it was. It was probably about 1000 ft. away from me.

BFRO,Oregon,Hood River,5816,NA,1968,NA,NA,Summer,B,animal,NA,"I would like to begin saying I saw saw a phone number a couple years ago that went 1800 big foot. I was very tempted to phone, but just couldn't. I have thought about my encounter quite often, with no one to share it with. About a year ago we purchased a computer. I have been learning how to use it along with the internet.This is were I came across your web site. I have read a lot of the posted sightings. Report #5473 had one similarity to what occured on a logging site in Oregon, year 1968. I contacted your site and inquired if you were interested in a sighting this old. Two researchers contacted me via email with an encouraging yes. At the time of the encounter I was 18 years old. I was working for a company out of Eugene Oregon. My job was to install radio signialing equipment on logging equipment. These logging sites were sometimes close to cities and more often quite distant. It was summer 1968 with real nice weather. This job was located around 40 to 50 miles north east of Estacata Oregon in the cascade mountains south of Mount Hood, elevation around 3500 feet.. I arrived on site long after the logging crew had left for the day. I estimate the time at 19:30 Hrs. The Radio was to be installed on a yarder. This machine has spools that hold cable that is used to bring logs to a central point, commonly called a landing. This macine is bolted down on two logs that are about three feet in diameter and fifty feet long.I estimate the weight of this machine to be 45 tons. The running board which the operator stands on is around 2 to 21/2 feet above ground level. When the operator stands looking to the other side,he can just see over the haulback drum (spool). I set up my generator and started work. As time went on it became very dark. No moon and very dark! Around 22:30 hrs the hair stood up on the back of my neck. I knew I was being watched. Up until this time I had no indication of any thing out of the ordinary. This job had to be 35 miles from the nearest known person. I took down my drop light and directed it to a location directly behind me. I saw eyes looking directly at me. The only thing I could see were those eyes staring at me. We looked at each other for maybe 15 seconds. It then turned to its right and I could not see it any longer. I knew I needed to get out of there as soon as possible.I continued work at a faster pace! About ten miniutes later I smelled a repulsive odor. A light breeze was blowing from the other side of the yarder. At this point I wasn't sure what to do. My light was hanging on the roof support to my left. I slowly turned it to the direction of the smell, about 20 feet away across the haulback drum were those eyes again, but now I could make out the shape of a large animal, Black in color and very wide. I also noticed that under the eyes seemed to be shiny. The car was 20 to 30 feet away and down slope from me. I decided it was time to leave and return in the morning. The generator was small and normally easy to carry, running it was quite difficult. I managed to get to the car with a running generator and light. I shut down the generator and drove about 5 miles away and awaited daylight. I woke to the sound of the crew bus going by. I followed them back to the job and completed the installation. We tested the system and they went to work. I took a look around for footprints, but with all of the limbs and brush I was not able to find any. The chaser asked me why I was parked so far away. I told him my story. His reaction told me I was not the only one to see this animal. He pointed out two 55 gallon barrels that were carried up a log pile and tossed over the side of the landing. These barrels were full and weighed approximatly 475lbs. This animal had to have great strength to accomplish this, thus report #5473. I will admit I was terrified, I think the gererator attracted its attention. It never came any closer than 20 feet and never made a sound. I installed many more radio systems after this and many were at night, but never saw or herd any thing again.",NA,Estacada,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3500,2230,NA,clear,NA,NA,"logging area , mountain range , forest","douglas fir trees , mountain hemlock trees",NA,NA,10,6.10,20.0,6.666666667,yes,1,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,black,NA,NA,golden,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,shiny eyes,NA,"staring at witness , large 400+ pouinds barrels tossed",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"Here is a little more detail the witness was able to provide: ""It's size was great, I could only make out It's black shape slightly, shoulders up.

I think the change in smell alerted me to something across from me."" The witness recalls the color of the eyes as a bit golden, though he mainly remembers them as being very bright. Like, in his wording, ""a cat's eyes."" In conversation with me, he estimated the height of the creature to be approximately eight feet. He remembers the weather conditions that day as warm and clear. There was no moon that night. He feels that the sighting occurred in August. Briefly, two things I would like to note: First, this is a very good example of a report on the cusp of being a Class A or a Class B sighting. It has been filed as Class B only because there was no clear visual of the creature. Second, I would like to say that, yes, BFRO would like to hear about older reports. Reports such as this provide useful, long-term information on a given area, showing sasquatch presence over time and possibly behavior patterns within a given area. No one with a thirty-year-old sighting should shy away from reporting it to us, as it could well prove quite useful.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=5816
BFRO,Oregon,Hood River,3050,NA,1970,October,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"I was 15 years old, deer hunting East of the Mt Hood National Wilderness Area in Oregon. It was 1970. My Dad stuck me on a huge stump and went off to my right and our neighbor, W. went off to my left. The stump partially embraced me like a recliner. It was huge! Also, it as a good place to sit for a long time. My view was a meadow and heavy brush. Large Douglas Firs bodered the area...perhaps 3 acres. This was back when large fir trees still existed and these were being logged in abundance. I had never heard of Bigfoot, read anything about him or had any idea what so ever that such things existed in the woods. I am very comfortable in the woods. Evidently, I was trusted by my father and neighbor as they left me with a 303 British. Ok.... Big deal. After about 2 hours later I hear a rustle to my right. I click off my safety and slowly move my gun and body to see. Immediately, I thought it was my father running at full speed through the woods. Odd behavior but I click my safety back on and watched what I thought was my Dad run through the brush. He ran about 50' in front of me from right to left. The heavy brush came up to his breast area. Heavy steam came out in regular intervals as he ran. It was quite a site. I didn't understand why the branches weren't making that scraping noise on his parka. My dad wore a rust color parka popular at the time. One thing he never did was wear the hood. But, it appears as though Dad had his hood on while running though the wood. Odd? My dad was an athelete and physicaly fit most of his life. Played all the sports. I thought he was particularly athletic running though the woods with amazing grace. I sat there ponderng what had just happened when I hear another crashing noise to my right. I look and there is dad, stomping through the woods making all kinds of noise. He was still hunting! I was stunned to see him on my right as I just saw him pass from view on my left! Now he looks real tiny and the brush is 1' to 2' over his head. He looks small and weak and definately not athletic. I could hear his every foot step. I'm 15. Too young I think to be scared. I know every type of animal in the woods and am struggling with what I had just seen. The hunt has obviously come to a close as dad is exhausted. Still confused, I said, ""Did you just run by here?"" Dad replies, ""Are you kidding, I can barely stand up out here!"" Then I explained something had run by. I though it was you. Only, when I saw you I realized what I saw was huge,very fast and very powerful. I described to my dad what I had seen. I was not frieghtened. What I saw was an intelligent human looking animal running with purpose, speed, grace and power. The kind you find from creatures in nature. Although he was running fast the noise was minimal. He made less noise running than my dad did walking. About 6 months later I was reading a story in a magazine about some kids in The Dalles, Oregon chasing and shooting a creature. My blood went cold. It was then I realized what I had seen. In the subsequent years I have seen numerous stories on the creature. Science says without proof, they don't exist. Normal people are labled as kooks or they saw a bear, deer or an elk.

Being the youngest I was sent up the ridge while my father and uncle went around one side and my mom watched the other side. After I broke over the top I came upon a game trail of sorts, chewed up ground but no discernable tracks. It seemed to be headed in the direction I was going so I followed it. When I came to an area that had less undergrowth I saw the tracks I'd been following. They were huge human like footprints, about 1-1/2 times longer than my boots (size 10-1/2) and were spaced farther apart than a human gait. I continued following them with the hair on the back of my neck standing up. Suddenly I saw a red hat. It was my mom, so I signaled for her to come down where I was. I showed her the tracks and she said something like let's get out of here. We followed the tracks a little farther where they crossed the road. Close to where they crossed we found a pile of feces. It resembled bear feces in that it contained berries. At that point we made a B-line for the truck. When we got there I saw my dad and uncle working a brushy draw, apparently they had seen a deer. I went up the hill towards them through an old burn area and came upon another set of the tracks. I left my orange hat there to mark the spot.

BFRO,Oregon,Hood River,671,NA,1975,December,6,Winter,A,animal,NA,"My father was driving eastbound on Interstate 84 at about 7pm, it was raining, but not torrential. It was dark. We crested a point of the hwy.when we seen brake lights and swerving in front of us so we slowed thinking it must be an animal or a wreck up ahead. when we got to the area of the braking we noticed a probable person running with arms swinging along the divide between the two directions of travel. My first impression was that it was someone wearing a fur type coat with a hood as I could see the wet hair. My father was in the outside lane and there was a car in the inside lane, the car ahead and inside slamed on the brakes as the figure crossed in front of their car, and my father also slowed way down. At this time the figure crossed in front of our car and my father says he felt the car hit the lower portion of the leg and made eye to eye contact with it. At that time it started to run along the outside lane still with the flow of traffic, at that time we came up to it's side. I was in the passenger side of the car and looked up at this figure as we commensed to pass. My wife was in the rear passenger window and my mother in the center of the front seat. I looked straight into his face at about 3-4 feet, and saw a look of total fright and terror in it's eyes. At that moment it made a 90 degree turn away from our oncoming car and right into the rear drivers side of an oncoming pickup with a camper on it and literally bounced off the rear corner of the camper and up about a 60 degree incline and into the trees. When I got home I called the State Patrol and asked where I was to report an unusual sighting, and he asked me if I thought It was a UFO, I told him no and he said a Bigfoot, I said well something like that. He told me to call the shariff of the county in which it happened and I did. When I called them I went through the same conversation. I told him the facts as I knew them. He knew I was a little aprehensive, and told me not to feel aprehensive about turning in the sighting as he had taken quite a few reports that night on the same sighting and four of those where police officers. This report was taken by Peter Byrns and Barbara Wasson with NASI. Many years later,just a few months ago I had dinner with Peter in Portland, Oregon just before he moved to California and he told me that one thing he was impressed with in this report was not only that so many people at one time saw it but that two days later in the same spot but in the westbound lane they had the same report with multiple sightings. He surmised that purhaps the creature was returning back to the river the opposite direction as our sighting.

BFRO,Oregon,Hood River,8680,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1980,July,27,Summer,B,vocalization,NA,"We were up late at night in a second-story bedroom of my grandparents’ Dee, Oregon, home, at about 2:00 AM in the summer of 1980. There was a full moon. My brother was practicing taking photographs of the moon. He was taking pictures from our south-facing window (no screen) that looks out over a beautiful orchard landscape in the Hood River Valley that leads up to the foot of Mount Hood. The window is above a long, straight, east-to-west gravel driveway that leads up to a detached garage. The property is approximately 1 acre. Everyone else was already asleep in adjacent rooms. My brother and I were up late talking while he took pictures. He probably had the window open for about 30 minutes. The bed was to the side of the window. He would get up from the bed, move toward the window, prop his elbows on the windowsill, and steady the camera for some photos. Then he would sit back down on the bed and use his flashlight to adjust the settings on the camera and replace spent film. We kept the lights off in the room so he could get good shots of the moon. My brother was at the bed when we suddenly heard a very loud, strange, human-like vocalization that sounded like a slowly rising, low-pitched moan. As the pitch rose, it seemed to get louder like whatever was making the sound was approaching closer. Everything else was silent. It really sounded very close to the house, like it was nearing the window, which seemed strange and scary because we were on the second story. The sound seemed very focused in our direction. This eerie moan made us both freeze! After about ten seconds of being petrified, my brother shot up out of bed and slammed the vertically-opening window shut. He later said that he quickly looked toward the source of the sound before shutting the window. The moan seemed to come from the line of orchard trees in the shadows about 20 feet from the house along the south edge of the driveway. But he did not see anything unusual. We nervously muttered to each other, “What was that!?” We listened for more, but the moan had stopped. We were too afraid to open the window again. My brother waited a few minutes, and then shined his flashlight from the closed window into the orchard. But we saw and heard nothing the rest of that night. We went into the orchard the next morning but found nothing unusual in the area of the sound. We told our family about what had happened, but they said that they had been asleep. They brushed off the story because we were just teenagers at the time. We have been trying to explain that night ever since. We thought that it might have been someone playing a weird prank on us. But we were only summer visitors to the area and had never met any of the neighbors, the nearest home being about a half-mile away. We considered that it might have been some strange animal. But it sounded semi-human, and unlike any sound we had ever heard. Of course, there has always been the ghost theory. We never thought that it might have been a Bigfoot until recently, when we found out about www.bfro.net and heard the 1994 Ohio Field Recordings from Columbiana County (WAV Format, 1350 KB). It is the same sound we heard! I got chills the first time I listened to the recording (I still do). I was immediately transported back to that night in Dee, Oregon. If we would have known about the possibility of it being a Bigfoot, we would have searched for more evidence, or perhaps we would have been more bold during the encounter—easy to say in hindsight though. This story has been in our family ever since that night.

I guess about 15 miles or so from Hood River, Or. I think it was either 1981 or 1982. I was born in 69. My uncle Doug let me ride Babe ( his mare) up to bald beautte. I was pretty sure my cousin James was the one with me but a head injury to James has rendered his memory poor. Anyway, this was our plan, ride up there, have cocoa, ride back. Well we soon realized that wasn't goin to happen cause we saw light would be long gone by the time we made it to the top. We decided to get off the horse and drink cocoa that was in our thermos. One of us tied the horse. We were above bone ditch but below bald beautte. It was on a hillside. There was still enough light to see but it was getting near time to go and Babe looked across the hill and her eyes got huge as she reared back trying to get loose. I looked where her eyes were looking and maybe 50 yds away or so this huge hairy man took one step towards us, maybe he was just walking, then turned 180 deg and walked away as if he cared less. I was so damn scared! I am trembling now as I recall this. I untied the horse and we ran as fast as we could. When we got back to grannys I told my mom but she didnt believe me!

BFRO,Oregon,Hood River,672,NA,1980,August,NA,Summer,A,animal,vocalization,"Four of us guys decided to hike up the mountain for an adventure sort of speak and get to the top of the mountain and set up camp for a night. We loaded our essentials on our backs and took off walking. We started out at the State dept. shed just south of the community of Mt. Hood and walked east up the mountain. It was about 12 midnight when we started out I was raised in the area and spent most of my time as I was growing up in the hills and knew them like the back of my hand and we thought it would be fun to travel at night, just to be different. About two hours later we arrived two thirds of the way up the mountain side, I would say that we were about 500 feet below the summit and stoped to rest for a bit before makeing the top. It was 2:20 am if I remember right. As we were sitting there talking all of a sudden a very loud and piercing scream came from the ridge above us, two long sustained screams followed by a very powerfull growl needless to say we were scared to death and litterally ran down the mountain and did not stop until we had arrived at the Hiway and returned home. I have heard just about every thing that there is in the woods and I know it was not and elk, deer, bear, mountain lion ect... The best way I can describe the scream is that it sounded like the alarm on a fire station, it was that loud. The previous fall a friend and I were in the same area down below this area walking and checking out Hiway 35 at the Baseline Dr. junction. It had flooded and washed out the hiway in 1980 two years prior to this and we were just looking to see how the rebuilding process was going. We had stoped on a large pile of gravel to rest and talk a bit, when what I thought was a man walked out of the woods and sat upon a stump. I asked my friend if he saw the man up there on the hill sitting and he said yes, but that it did'nt look like a person to him, that it looked strange, so we decided to walk towards it to get a better look it was about 600 to 700 feet away when we first saw it. We walked to where we were about 300 feet away. At that distance we could both see that it was not a man but it was covered with dark brown hair. It did not move, but seemed to see us it was looking directly at us the whole time since we had started walking toward it. After looking at it a moment I decided to wave my arm at it to see if I could get a response and it did move a bit kinda back and forth a bit like it was trying to see better or size us up I'm not sure which. At that time we were so excited and scared also, that we descussed going closer to see if this could be Bigfoot that I had heard of and so we did out of sheer adrinaline I'm sure because I was scared I know this for sure and my friend was to. So we reaced the bottom of the small foot hill it was on, but had lost site of it because it was back a ways from the crest of the top. We decided after a bit of descussion to go up toward the top of ! the area that it was in and did. When we got to where we could see the creature was gone. But, we arrived at the stump that it had sat on. there was no hair or evidence that anything was there except the tree had just been felled and in the center as is usual there were spikes that had been sticking straight up but now were smased flat and broken. This is no easy task unless you were to hit them with a sledge hammer ie... The grass was smased all around the stump and we could see were it had walked back into the tree line and followed for a couple hundred feet or so but we were so frightened that we left after only five minutes or so, but we did see back in the tree's aways there was a meadow with small young fir tree's and there limb's touched the ground. Under one there was a bed sort of like an elk bed but much larger, approximately 15 feet long by 8 feet wide and it looked like a large man had laid there proped up on an elbow or something. We left immediately after that and never saw it or anything like it again. I know this is strange but I swear to God this really happened and I have not told but a couple of people to this day, but I know that its out there and I've seen the tracks and hair samples to know its there, my grandfather saw it back in 1974 on Fir mountian and I was allowed by Peter Byrne to go along and so, ever since then and from those two experinces I'm convinced that the creature is out there and so, I just wanted to share this with you.",south of Bald Butte 500 feet below the surveyers ridge trail,Parkdale,Hwy 35,Bald Butte,NA,NA,NA,3000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,91.44,300.0,100,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,black,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,sitting on stump,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,witness has also heard screams,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=672
BFRO,Oregon,Hood River,670,Rob Alley,1986-1987,August,NA,Summer,A,animal,vocalization,"I drove four friends up from Portland to the south side of Mt Hood to spend three days on the trail that goes round the mountain. We were all seventeen or so and there were two other couples and myself. On the second day we had made it only to the east side of the mountain going clockwise, I think it was called Sherwood Camp. We found the campsite late and decided to set up on our own near a creek on the opposite side of the trail from the campground sign a hundred yards or so off the trail in a fairly level open part of the forest. There was a creek nearby, there were huckleberries out and we set up our three tents close together.The next morning I got up about 5:30 but noticed from my tent flap the others had all slept in. Some movement about seventy feet away in the berry bushes and evergreens caught my eye. I saw a large light beige colored creature all covered with hair 7 to eight feet tall, its' back to me, trying to reach something, a branch I guess, about 15 ft. off the ground. Not more than 10 ft away was this other creature the same but small, all covered with hair except for the front of the hands, the bottoms of the feet and around the eyes. The second one was only about 3 ft high and was bending over picking up a stick which it was trying to put in its' mouth. The little one was a bit darker in color, a dark beige. The hair on both was up to four inches long at most. The big one was really thickset, I could not make out any of the front of ""her"" because she was turned away from me almost the whole time, about a minute. I thought she was the little one's mother. She gave a kind of grunt at the little one like she didn't want him doing that and he dropped the stick. At that moment I was on all fours leaning out of the tent, trying to see better, and my hand popped on a twig, and the big one looked right at me, but all she did for a second was grunt again at the little one and she reached down, stepped over and took his hand. It was like she was motioning for him to go with her, and looked in my direction one more time, grunted softly again and they were gone behind the trees. Their faces were like an ape around the lips and jaws, you know, their jaws jutted out a bit. Their heads weren't pointed but I could see by the bare patches around the eyes and skin on the hands their skin was a kind of brownish gray. My friends never saw anything, but after we hitch-hiked back to the jeep and were on the way out, I slowed down for a ranger and he stopped to make sure we were OK. He was an older guy,I didn't get his name, he had gray hair and a bit of a paunch. He was a nice guy, he said this was his first season doing this, and when I told him what I had seen his eyebrows kind of went up. I didn't report this to anybody else."" When I asked for other details K. added, ""Well when she walked away she sort of waddled from side to side a bit."" When I asked her aboutsmell she replied ""nothing that I could tell"".. did you look for tracks?..""no, I was a little scared, we just all got up and packed up after breakfast and I didn't even want to go over there.""... "" All in all it was a kind of scary but really fascinating thing, the whole thing couldn't have taken more than a minute, a minute and a half at most, but it seemed like five.The details really stuck in my mind.""

Ex: Dark features that kind resembled eyes and arms coming across a leg. Like if you were to sit over your feet in a crouched position. It was about 3pm so the effects could have been from lighting and the trees. Either way I thought it looked cool and wanted to go get my camera.

Upon arriving back at the location, about 15 min later, I noticed my pyramid of rocks was knocked over and when I looked across the way there was nothing.

I personally have heard the sounds of Bear, cougar, coyotes, elk, dear, bear hunting hounds and basically all other wildlife in the area. It was nearing dusk and my father and I decided to each head a different direction on the High Cascades hiking trail near Boulder Lake and just a little South of the Badger wilderness area. We had decided to go for about 20 minutes and then return back figuring to return to the car around dark. I headed north following the trail into the fringe of the Wilderness area. About 10 minutes or so in I heard a yelping kind of sound. It wasn't anything I have heard before. The closest animal sound that I have ever heard would be like a chimpanzee, but much deeper. It was not human sounding by any means, but more human than say a cougar or bear. This sound intrigued and scared me. I followed the trail a little further, I then began to hear a sound that I can only describe as being the sound of wood being torn open, not a rotten log mind you, but the sound of wood splintering on a massive scale. This was a bit troublesome, but I pushed on a little further, my curiosity pushing me on. The trail made a slight bend to the right emerging from a small thicket of Fir trees and angling down the hill fairly steeply. I could see that there was a bit of a drop about 150 yds ahead of me and a log laying across the top lip of the drop. That's when saw something. It was a head and shoulders, with the back turned towards me, just beyond the log. There was no visable neck at all, but the head was clearly defined above the shoulder. I stopped and watched, I started to think it was just a stump and my eyes and instincts playing with me. I took another step forward and then it moved. It's movement was like when you hear something and you cock your head to try to align your ears to catch the sound better, but the whole torso swiveled, just a couple of inches. That was all I needed to see, I backed up the trail until I couldn't see it anymore, then turned and walked as rapidly as I could till I got back to the car.

Hood off of Highway 35. We came across a sign for the Barlow Road (US Forest Service Road 3530) and decided it would be fun to drive into the woods and perhaps see some of the wagon ruts. We drove to the edge of a clearing just north of a deserted campground and stopped to take a look around. Just after getting out of the car we noticed an extremely large pile of fresh droppings about 10ft from where we had parked. My wife, who has had experience hunting bears, elk and other large mammals, commented that the droppings looked odd and did not look like bear or elk droppings. They were more ""human"" in appearance but way too large for a person to have made. After a few minutes of looking around we both noted that we no longer heard any other animal noises of any sort. It seemed way too quiet. We had been visiting sites within a few miles of this place all day and this place really stood out as being eerily quiet. It was at this moment that my wife stated that it felt like we were being watched. I agreed. The whole environment just seemed really strange. We both got an extremely creepy feeling and decided to just turn around and leave.

BFRO,Oregon,Hood River,5100,NA,2002,September,25,Fall,A,animal,activity,"On Tuesday, September 24, 2002 I was hiking alone on the Ruckel Creek trail near Cascade Locks. The time was about 4 p.m. I was beginning descending from the area known as The Benson Plateau. Although I am not sure of my exact position it was probably close to 45 deg. 38' 21"" N, 121 deg. 52' 24"" W at an elevation of about 3,300 feet. The trail was very dry and dusty and the steep decent required that I walk very carefully. As a result I made almost no sound at all. There was suddenly a very loud crashing sound from close by and my thoughts were that a bear had been surprised. At first I saw nothing, but the sound indicated that an animal was fleeing up the steep hillside. Then for about two seconds from a distance of about a hundred feet I could clearly see what looked like a large guerrilla running up the hill. Only the back was visible and it was black. The animal was only visible from the waist up. It had powerful back and shoulders and a very large head that rose to a distinct hump much as it does in pictures of some apes. I do not know how big it was other then to say it was a lot bigger then me. The head was particularly massive I thought. The animal apparently tripped and fell forward, but caught itself and kept moving up through the dense thicket. At that moment it turned its head enough for me to see its head and face in profile. It had a distinct nose but there was little else I could distinguish. At this point I went for my camera. This took a few seconds. When I looked up again I could see motion but could not make out the animal. There was a fallen tree about a hundred and fifty feet up the hill and it began to rock up and down at a uniform rate of about 1 HZ. It made a corresponding creaking and rubbing sound and this continued for some time, perhaps fifteen seconds keeping my attention drawn to that spot but seeing nothing but the tree bobbing up and down like it was being deliberately shaken at a uniform amplitude. Then it suddenly stopped and I could hear nothing. Then I noticed some motion about fifty feet to the right of the tree and thought I could see a face looking at me. The face seemed smaller that the animal I had saw but it still looked like a face and shoulders against a lighter backdrop. I stood with the camera ready knowing that the animal was still there and expecting it to stand up and again show itself. But this waiting game went on for perhaps two minutes. Then I began to wonder if the animal was in fact gone and perhaps I was looking at some strangely shaped stump because it did not move and I could not see it well enough to tell exactly what it was. At this point I took a picture thinking I might blow up the photo later for closer study to determine if anything was in fact there. It occurred to me that I should move around a bit and try to find a better angle. But there was no better position then where I was and caution prohibited me from moving closer. When I returned to my original position I no longer could see the face. I stayed around and listened and watched for a while but noticed nothing. The trail itself was very dusty and took prints well. My own prints were very clear but there were no other prints that I could see. During the incident I smelled nothing. When the digital picture was lightened and adjusted for contrast the head that appeared to be looking at me did look like it could be real. But in the background was what could be another far bigger animal. The larger image in the background is about the right size for the animal I saw. But the front looks like a light tan. I just took the picture and that is all I know about it. The picture quality is poor. Obviously if the animals were willing to pose I might have done better. I went back to the site two times to try to locate the exact position from clues in the picture but have been unable to relocate it exactly. I wanted to get another look and take another picture from the same location just to make sure I was not seeing something that just looked like what I was trying to see. The interesting part is right in the middle of the picture and needs lightning to see properly. I did go back about two days later and explore the place where the animal might have been headed. This area is called Rudolf Spur. All I found there was a pile of shit that was flat as a pancake and looked like tar.

The photograph that Fred took of the creature does not provide any real detail; the distance to the creature is too great and the concealment in surrounding foliage is too great. Still, Fred is to be commended for the preparedness and determination necessary to even attempt a photograph under the circumstances.

BFRO,Oregon,Hood River,22742,Cindy Dosen,2001,April,9,Spring,B,vocalization,NA,"My friend B.P. and I decided to spend an evening at Eagle Creek State Park along the Columbia River on I-84 at milepost 41 East of Portland, OR. We had a cook out camp fire in the Community Kitchen there. It was on April 9th, 2001, a Monday, which we purposely chose to avoid the crowds. Not that there are many people out there in the Winter but a Monday evening will usually guarantee no others will be around. It was cold out, just above freezing, and it had been raining quite a bit earlier. We had a nice dinner. We had cooked on our portable BBQ earlier in the evening which had included BBQ steak. We had already picked up and put away all of our gear so we were ready to go when we wanted to. At 11:50 PM we had just looked at our watches thinking it was time to go, when from across the creek, about 200 yards away, came a shrieking yell that both startled and shocked us. The yell came from across the creek, up on a ridge due west of us. At first I thought it was an emergency siren going off at nearby Bonneville Dam, but the siren quality of yell quickly turned into a very breathy roar of some very large animal. It lasted about 10 seconds. We stared at each other in disbelief. Before either of us could utter a word, another yell, just like the first, came from behind the Community Kitchen no more that 100 feet from us. This was the first time that I had ever experienced the hair standing up on the back of my neck. I thought I would have been able to identify any animal that lived in the forests of Oregon but this call was completely new to me. We stood there silent, listening for about 5 minutes. We knew that we were right in the middle of the two calls so maybe these two animals were going to meet right where we were standing. We then decided to leave. I was so glad. When I was inside my truck we locked the doors right away. We did leave our left-over food behind for them in case they were interested in that. I was skeptical about Bigfoot before but I try to keep an open mind. The only place I have heard the same exact calls since was in a film that was a 70's Class B movie called The Bermuda Triangle. Another thing to note on that occasion was that the snow line was unusually low still for that time of year. We thought that maybe this had driven these bigfoots down low in search of food.

After BBQ steaks and packing up to head out, they heard a shrill yell followed by low howl. The sound came from across a creek, up on a small ridgeline 200 yards from them. Around 3-5mins later another similar type of yell came out of the brush 100 yards behind them in the opposite direction. This yell was more deep, resonating, breathy, and had a growling sound to it.

BFRO,Oregon,Jackson,647,NA,1988,NA,NA,Fall,A,animal,footprint,"My hunting partner Ed and I were into the second week of the Oregon bow season. It was about 0600 when we came upon a stock pond. These ponds are fed by a small spring or small creek. We decided to circumnavigate it to see if we could see what was watering in the area. I went left Ed went to the right. I hadn’t gone far when I came to a depression in the muddy gravely pond edge. It looked like a very big heavy person had left a footprint there. I got down and saw that there were toe impressions at the front. Well I called Ed over to see this and he said there was another one behind the first. We backtracked the prints and found what appeared to be skid marks on the hill side of the pond. This was just next to the small trickle of water which fed the pond. The hair on the back of my neck stood right up. We went up the hill for about forty yards but found indistinguishable impressions in the trashy undergrowth. We went back down and tracked them in the other direction and the impressions (overturned pebbles, broken and bent grasses) went about 100 yards down a hill into a ravine thick with manzineta and small scrub oak. We then went back to the foot tracks and covered them with logs so they wouldn’t be destroyed. Went home and got some plaster of Paris. We made the impressions and we were shocked to find that there were definitely toes on one cast the other was in too much gravel to make a good impression. At the same time I took some pictures of Ed stretching to match the stride of the prints. The next week we went into the same area, same skid road, about 300 yards past the stock tank. We were walking side by side when something to my left and slightly behind us, up the hill aprox.100yards something caught my eye. I spun around to see what it was, and to my astonishment I saw a pair of legs running into the thick underbrush. I couldn’t see all of it because of the trees. My impression was of a two legged creature, animal, with long brown hair on the legs running away from us. Ed saw the branches swinging back into place but saw nothing else. We both got spooked and quickly went back to the truck and never hunted there again. I gave the plaster cast to my nephew in San Jose California and have never seen them again. I still have the photos of Ed stretching to match the stride. The foot prints measured 18"" long By 6"" across the heel, and 8"" across the ball of the foot. I got some hair samples from a star thistle down in the ravine and I still have them. Other comments: I'm an exited typist once I get started I type to beat the band, I can't spell worth a darn.

BFRO,Oregon,Jackson,8986,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,2004,July,3,Summer,A,animal,NA,"My wife, daughter and I were towing our trailer up to a local camp site on a Saturday morning for an overnight campout. I was driving along on the Prospect/Butte Falls highway. I came around a corner and was slowed down to about 30 mph. As we turned the corner, about 40 yards down the road on the right hand side, I saw what I thought was a man take a step from the road into the forest. I clearly saw an arm swing and a leg. What struck me strange was that he was pitch black from head to toe. I said to my wife, ""What was that?"" She said, ""I don't know."" At this point I am still thinking that it was a person, but that it was strange. There was a dirt logging road that crossed the highway right where the creature was standing. I started slowing down and expected to see a person, or a truck or camper on the road. As we went by and looked, there was nothing there. We continued down the road and my wife and I talked about what we had seen. My daughter was in the back seat of the truck and did not see anything. I all happened very quickly. I did not see anything until it moved as I was proocuppied by driving and towing. My wife saw it standing there by the road before it moved and clearly saw hair and could see both sides of the torso. I kept running over in my mind what it might have been. I have lived in this area all of my life and have seen every animal that lives in the woods. This did not fit in any catagory. The only thing that color is a black bear, and this clearly was not a bear. We finally agreed that it may have been a bigfoot. We decided to hurry to out camp and drop the trailer and get back down and look for tracks. I had my camera and my intention was to find some tracks and get some pictures of them. We went to camp and hurried back to the spot. The time since we went by was about an hour. The logging road turned out to be very dry and hard. I searched all around in the forest and on the other side of the highway for tracks, but could not find anything that was clearly a bigfoot track. I went back to were it was standing an stood in the same spot and was looking up in the tree standing there looking for a bees nest or something that perhaps a bear might be interested in. I was still trying to eliminate all other possibilities. Then it occured to me that when I had seen this creature step off of the road that it had stepped behind some branches on this tree. As I looked up I realised that the branches were way above my head. I am 6' 4"". This thing was big.

BFRO,Oregon,Jackson,64111,Kevin Llewellyn,2011,October,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"This happened in early to mid October 2011 when my wife and I were driving west towards mile marker 26 on Hwy 66 in southern Oregon to go hunting. To the best of my recollection this is what happened: It was between mile marker 26-27. My wife were cruising along at 45-55 miles an hour. While heading to a hunting location we will still be looking for deer but going at a faster speed till we get to our next dirt road. I call this speed hunting. We were driving a stretch of this highway and it was just before mile marker 26, on the east side. It was kind of straight with a small bump or hill in the road in the near distance. I was driving and on my left was an area next to the road that was slightly treed but easy to see through. We could see about a 100 yards straight back off the road before it became more heavily treed. Coming up fast on our left was where the trees got thick again and this semi clearing was going to end. So I would call this an L shaped tree line. Running to our left, away from the road and us we saw something moving very fast. My observation of what I saw was a 7-8 foot tall, hairy creature running almost full throttle. Since I was the one driving I couldn’t give my 100 % full attention to this thing running. The things that I did notice were it was very hairy, ran on 2 legs and had long arms. To be more specific, the hair was black and flowing from head to waist. Black hair from head to torso then a reddish cinnamon hair color from torso to waist. I can’t remember from the waist down for some reason. I think it happened too fast and I was a little caught off guard. It was sprinting but for some reason I didn’t feel it was full speed. I’m pretty sure it was running because we caught it off guard and spooked it. What I did notice was it looked like a lot of the Bigfoot that I have seen on TV shows. So after we passed it I looked at my wife and I asked her “did you see that?” She said yes. We both agreed we just saw a Bigfoot but yet part of us just wanted to say no we didn’t! We talked a little about it and kind of dismissed it having second guessing ourselves. So the next year it was hunting time again and we found ourselves going down Hwy 66 again. We started looking for the same spot we had our encounter. Both of us had really never talked about this the past year. So I brought it up again to my wife and I described what I saw the previous year. Strangely enough our remembrance of what we both saw was pretty close. We’ve been hunting for years and have seen a lot of animals out in the wild. We have seen Antelope, Elk, Deer, Bear, Bison, Bobcats, Emu, Turkeys and other creatures. We know for a fact it was not anything we had ever seen before. This thing stayed on 2 legs and never went down on all fours. My wife and I are not attention seekers and have nothing to gain from this. We enjoy just keeping a low profile in life but we felt we should say something about what we saw. I figure no one in there right mind would put on a Sasquatch suit during hunting season to get attention.

She saw; red-brown eyes, closed mouth, square yet rounded head, hair as long as eighteen inches except on face and legs, high cheek bones, brow ridge above eyes, flat chin.

Both agreed its height was eight feet or more. She saw the bottom of huge feet come out of the grass as it ran away. They were bald and brown with a tint of purple on the bottom. As it ran, the hands were in fists with the thumbs up but bent back. Both agreed it ran smoothly and fast but could have ran faster. They could see muscles ripple in the hair as it was running, so it was not someone in a ghillie suit. It ran in the direction of the dirt road they were to turn onto and the wife told the husband not to go there. They did not think to look for tracks. The husband said if there is ever a next time, he would stop so he could see more detail. But the wife got the feeling it wanted them gone, that it was the aggressor. They have not returned to that area to hunt. She has since been nervous to camp except in a camper RV.

BFRO,Oregon,Jefferson,5610,NA,2002,October,25,Fall,A,animal,NA,"This sighting took place while I was on a fishing trip with my girlfriend, another couple, and their mom. My friends were staying at the resort cabins at one of my favorite fall fishing lakes. By the time we arrived (delayed by wiring problems on my boat trailer) it was about 3 a.m. We talked untill there was little reason to go to bed, just to have to get right back up to catch the morning bite. About an hour-and-a-half before sunrise my friend Wes and I decided to go for a little walk down to one of the streams that feed out of the lake. I was curious to see what the fish were doing. We both had flashlights, shining them into the stream as we walked along trying to spot fish. The further we went, the more uneasy I became and I have been in these woods all of my life and never felt like this ever. I asked Wes if he felt kind of weird he said, ""Kind of."" We decided we'd head back. We moved to a different cabin closer to the lake. After the evening fish I returned at late light, bummed about missing a very large brown trout. I spent most of the evening listening to fish jump and looking at stars. Wes' mom went to bed first and about 11:45p.m the rest of us went to bed. My girlfriend and I were not sleeping in the cabin with Wes and his family. We were sleeping in the back of a full size Chevy Surburban, mainly because Angela and I wanted a little privancy. Angela and didn't go right to sleep. This was about an hour-and-a-half after everyone said good night at the camp fire. I sat up to smoke a cigarette and I was looking out the rear side window when something caught my eye. The cabins where we were staying are not very large. There was outdoor lighting attached to the middle of the roof line of the cabin. At first I thought it was the wind moving the tree branches or bushes but something wasn't right. I then began to realize was I was seeing. I thought maybe I was a little more tired than I thought and that my eyes were playing tricks on me. Except the trick didn't go away. Just to make sure, I asked Angela to sit up and look around and tell me what she sees. I totally expected to look stupid and have her tell me she saw nothing. I did not tell her what I was seeing or where I was seeing it. I looked down at the floor. Angela sat up and it wasn't even two seconds before she visually locked onto the same thing I did. Still looking at the floor, I asked, "" What do you see."" Her first word was, ""Yeti,"" and with that things now felt real. We both became excited, scared, and curious. I was a bit more uneasy with how the bigfoot was moving and acting. It was about 50 feet away back in the tree line on the other side of the cabin, about 15 feet away from Wes' mom's truck. It was standing just out of the light, so as not be directly seen. It was about 7-1/2 to 8 feet tall, covered in hair, very broad in the shoulder and across the chest. It wasn't as bulky as what is in the Patterson film. What made me very uneasy was its movements and actions. It wasn't coming forward. It had one arm up above its head and to the side, resting on a tree. It was rapidly rocking from side to side, and bobbing up and down. Angela made a statement about getting out to maybe get closer to it. I was in the process of telling her, ""No!"" when the next surprise was realized. Anglea points out that there's more than one. About two feet behind the tailgate of my friend's moms truck, was crouched not one, but two of what appeared to be smaller bigfoots. They were crouched close together, sitting motionless and looking directly at us. They looked like they were younger ones, compared to the big one still rocking back and forth by the tree. They were not as broad in the shoulders or chest. Angela and I wondered what to do, quietly talking to each other for five or ten minutes. I decided to wake up Wes by yelling toward the window of his bedroom, which was in the middle of the back wall of the cabin. Wes answered back and I told him to look out his window. At first he couldn't see anything through the window. I didn't tell him what to look for or what I was seeing for fear of him thinking we were pulling a joke or that we were totally out of our minds. As he opened the window, I asked him, ""Do you see it?"" His response was, ""Oh, my #%&^@ God!"" Wes didn't say another word, which made me even more uneasy. I couldn't deal with it anymore. I jumped up to the front seat and was gonna start up the rig to back them off a little. When I got up front, I couldn't find the keys. I became a bit panicky. I found the keys and started up the Chevy with a big ""vrooom!"" and it hardly seem to bother them. I then decided if I was going to see Bigfoot, then by god, I'm gonna try to get a good look!! I was parked in such a way that I had to pull way out and swing the front end around for my lights to hit them directly. As soon as the Chevy moved, they took off back into the trees and bushes. I then headed down the road toward a picnic aera where they might cross the road. On the way, Angela said she had enough and didn't want to be around the bigfoot anymore. I turned around, ended up taking a wrong turn finding, and myself driving cross country through the cabins and the resort. I was turned around so badly I didn't know where I was. Angela spotted the cabin where we stayed the first night. I then began to drive out to the highway to leave because Angela didn't want to return until daylight. Just before I got to the highway, I remembered my friends at the cabin and the fact that they had their newborn baby with them. Angela agreed we couldn't leave them there, so we returned. Wes said that as we were driving off, something ran across the road behind us on two legs. Angela and I decided to leave the Chevy parked halfway blocking the road and go inside the cabin. After we got inside, I asked Wes if he'd seen what we saw, because I still could not take in the fact that this really happened. Wes told me he definitely saw what he belives to be a bigfoot. he explained that he became silient because of the two smaller ones at the back of his mom's truck. After twenty minutes had gone by, I needed a smoke real bad and Wes' mom wanted something to drink. Both were in my rig. Wes was the first to step out side. On the way back to the cabin, we heard a bunch of comotion down toward the lake, like something running through bushes, snapping and breaking limbs. We ran to the front door of the cabin. Just as we started up the steps, I fell onto the porch, scaring Wes to death. Once inside, we talked and tried to rationalize everything that had happened. Things were quiet outside from then on, other than the fact that a raccoon thumped on our door, which startled us. What was strange was that the raccoon seem to want to come into the cabin.

BFRO,Oregon,Josephine,3702,NA,1975,July,NA,Summer,A,animal,NA,"In 1975 I lived on Coyote Creek Road in Wolf Creek Oregon, and used to spend summer days at a popular, isolated swimming hole about 12 miles out a dirt road that ran between Wolf Creek and the Rogue River. We called it the ""Jesus Saves"" swimming hole after some graffitti sprayed on the rocks. In mid summer I was there with a friend, we were the only people in sight. I was washing my hair in the creek and looking up between my legs I saw a head peeking over a fallen log about 60 feet up the hill behind me, slightly to my left. Though I spent much time alone in the woods, this felt really creepy to me. My first reaction was to stand up and yell thinking a ""peeping tom"" was sneaking up to take a peak as this was a skinny dipping hole and my friend and I were following that fine tradition. As I stood and turned quickly, the head slunk down to disappear behind the log. Instantly I had these simultaneous impressions: this large round head with brownish hair (features were indistinct due to the angle of the sun) moved like an animal, not a human, the hair was standing up on the back of my neck; and I felt panic along with a need to flee. Within seconds I told my friend something was stalking us and we needed to leave NOW and looked back to the log -- 25 feet beyond the log was a clump of scrub oak. I clearly sas the head, shoulder, arm, and upper torso of a very tall creature standing upright and melting into the trees. This was not a bear. It was not a human. It was brownish and hair covered. Within 90 seconds my friend and I swam across the creek and climbed the rocks below the trail. Feeling less frightened I stopped and together we searched the hillside across the creek. We saw absolutely nothing. During the early 70's I had three other encounters in the Wolf Creek area where I heard something inexplicable and had the same sensation of panic and hair actually raising on the back of my neck. This story describes myt only visual experience. In those days many folks lived an isolated lifestyle far back in the mountains.

This witness also had a noteworthy incident about a year before the Wolf creek encounter. She was living near Wimer OR. on twenty acres near Sykes Creek Rd. (Jackson Co.). Because of the remote location, it was necessary in the winter for her to hike the last mile to her home. She was on one of these hikes with her dog at about 10 pm one winter's night, when she heard the heavy footsteps of something walking in the brush. Her dog began to bark. Her first thought was that it could be her neighbor, who was a large man. She called out her neighbor's name, but there was no answer. The footsteps did not stop with the call and her dog began to growl and back up against her leg. At this point the witness felt threatened and frightened. She ran back to her car and ended up spending the night at a friend's house.

At that time, the dog began to get very agitated and was barking and trying to get out of the truck. The dog leaped from the window to the ground.

There was a bank that went up from the road next to the truck. The witness said that he heard something moving in the brush above him. When he looked up, he saw something moving. Then the creature stepped out into the open about 40 feet away up at the top of the bank. It looked at him for about 30 seconds, and made some grunting and mumbling sounds.

BFRO,Oregon,Josephine,680,NA,1996,November,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"Ok, I feel as if I need to qualify this statement. First of all, it was the discovery of this website and report submission form which inspired me to come forward and reveal my sighting incident. I have held off for over four years for fear of accusations of incompetence and lunacy-- after all, who doesn't poke fun at the ""freaks"" who tell of UFO and Bigfoot incidents? Second, I will confidently say that this sighting is absolutely true, and I will continue to have vivid memories of it all of my life. Third, I am a highly reputable source: I am a licensed English Teacher currently working at a large public high school in Oregon. I am educated, am of sound mind, and am not wasting my efforts here on a hoax of any sort. Finally, my most accurate narrative memory of my sighting: at the time of my sighting (see above for details), I was alone in a two bedroom residence located approx. 1/4 mile north of US Hwy. 199, on a gradual wooded slope. On this three-acre property, there are two horse pastures--one below the house and one above the house. Both pastures are surrounded by active hot- wire fences and contain two horses which may move freely between both lower and upper pastures. I was completing a research paper for a college class at the kitchen table. I had on light on, and my friend's dog (a small brown heeler) was on a 35' wire tether tied to the porch outside the small house. I was completely engrossed in schoolwork when I heard the dog outside begin to ""go ballistic."" I was quite alarmed by this, so I immediately tuned in to the animal's actions. I will never forget what I heard: all the dogs and horses from the other residences (which were quite far away--over several rises and ridges) were shrieking nonstop. Wanting to be cautious, I went to my gunsafe and removed a large caliber pistol and a powerful flashlight and headed towards the front door. I turned off all the lights in the house and I opened the front door, carefully searching with the flashlight and pistol before exiting. What I saw unnerved me. The small heeler was focused on the lower horse pasture and steadily loosing a quiet growl. The two horsed had moved to the upper pasture and were rustling about and neighing very unusually. I squatted down beside the dog (who did not pay me any attention- -very unusual) and pointed my flashlight in the direction of his muzzle. What I saw at this time nearly stopped my heart: there was a large figure crouched down outside the outer hot-wire in the tall grass beside a telephone pole. My light was reflected back at me by two small circular markers on the pole and further dispersed by the light fog making initial identification very difficult--I immediately thought ""bear."" To my complete shock, the dog suddenly screamed and leapt straight into the air with its hair bristled. Upon landing, it bolted under a pickup truck and whined like a puppy. As this happened (realize that this all occurred in but several seconds), I saw a creature rise up on TWO legs and begin to move along the hot-wire. I rose to a full standing position and aimed my pistol right on it. In my mind I was thinking ""bear, no, horse, no, man, no , God what the F*** is this thing?!"" I consciously tracked the creature with my pistol sights and flashlight beam (I was a Military Police Officer in the Army for over 5 years and trained in firearms tactics--it all came back at this moment, let me tell you!) for at least two full seconds in which time I SAW this HUGE THING take off in a full BIPEDAL RUN (the ""thud -thud"" rhythm and distinct movement of two legs/feet are unmistakable). I was more frightened than I can ever remember being (yeah, I am a grown man!) , and I bolted for the house and immediately armed myself with larger weapons and called my friend's father to come from Grants Pass to search for this thing. Upon his arrival, we drove down to the road outside the hot-wire where I estimated the creature to have been. Since the road was gravel, all we found was disturbed grass as if something large had moved through it--no footprints were located. For the remainder of the night and into the next morning, all the animals in the small community near Wilderville, OR were restless and noisy--the little heeler being the worst off for he did NOT calm down for a whole day.

BFRO,Oregon,Josephine,678,NA,2000,July,1,Summer,A,animal,NA,"Where to begin? Rochelle and I took our kids to the Oregon Caves National Park in southern Oregon. We ate lunch at a picnic table and then took a tour of the caves. The caves were spectacular. If you haven’t seen them before, they are a must see experience. Upon our exit of the cave, everyone usually turns to the right to go back down to the gift store and lodge. However, we are fresh from Alaska and love to hike in the outdoors (i.e., we just moved from Alaska to Oregon earlier this year). We decided to go left and hike up to see the Big Tree (i.e., a Douglas fir tree with a circumference of 40 feet that is about 800 to 1,000 years old). We hiked for about 2 miles into the forest up the mountain. As we were hiking up the trail, we smelled a very strong pungent smell. It was as strong as a skunk but it wasn’t a skunk (i.e., we know what a skunk smells like and it wasn’t a skunk even though it was as strong smelling as a skunk). We were standing down wind of the smell. We continued to hike up the trail and the trail started to switch back to the right as we climbed the mountain. There were plenty of tall trees and brush. I heard a faint sound (i.e., “Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa!). At first I thought it was the blood vessels pounding in my head because it was a constant sound / rhythm and I’m out of shape (i.e., it was a big mountain and we were constantly walking up, up, up, up). We kept walking up the trail. I heard the sound again except it was louder. Then I thought, “This sound is external – not internal.” We all stopped and I asked, “Do you guys here that sound?” Rochelle, Levi, Hannah, and Micah looked at me and nodded their heads in affirmation. Don’t ask me why but we continued to walk up the mountain through the very tall trees and brush. The sound continued in cycles of five to six repetitions (i.e., Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa). Louder and louder. Now the sounds were behind us. I started putting one and one together in my mind and my biological “fight or flight” responses kicked in. I stopped my family on the trail. I told them to stay quiet. I hiked up the hill to our left because I had to go poop ASAP (i.e., this happens when the biological “fight or flight” response kicks in). While I was doing my duty, I was scanning the woods down the mountain on the other side of the trail my family was standing on. That’s when I saw it. I saw it come out from behind one tree to the left and walk to another tree to the right. Then it looked back and was watching my family while they were standing on the trail. I’ve hiked through the woods in Alaska numerous times and believe me, I know what a grizzly bear looks like and I know what a black bear looks like. I was actually chased by a grizzly bear on the Russian river in Alaska about six or seven years ago. What I saw was not a grizzly bear or a black bear. What I saw walked upright on two legs like a human and it was much taller than a grizzly bear or a black bear. What I saw was Bigfoot (otherwise known as Sasquatch). I pulled up my shorts immediately, walked fast down to the trail and got my family moving up the mountain. I sure as heck wasn’t going to go back down the trail where we came from and go right to it. I didn’t tell my wife or children what I saw because I didn’t want them to panic. At this point, the adrenaline was rushing and I was very hypervigilent (i.e., constantly looking behind us and through the woods). The sound stopped but I wasn’t convinced we were safe. When we got to a place where the kids could stop and sit on a fallen log to rest and drink some water, I pulled Rochelle away and told here that she wasn’t going to believe what I saw. She believed me right away. She smelled the smell and she heard the repetitive cycles of “Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa” and she knows I’m not crazy. I told her to keep the kids going and that I would stay at the back to keep my eyes on what was behind us. I told her that if anything came up from behind us or through the woods from the side of us that I would run interference to protect them. I told her that if this happened, I wanted her to run the kids on the trail, don’t stop, and don’t look back. We agreed not to tell the children because we didn’t want to panic them. We never heard the sounds again and I never saw anything after that. We finally made it out of the woods about 1½ hours later. We sent the kids into the gift store to look for a gift because we had promised to buy them something if they were good hikers and didn’t complain. Rochelle and I sat on the bench outside the gift store and talked about the pro’s and con’s of whether or not to report what we smelled, heard, and saw (i.e., I don’t want people to think we are crazy). Rochelle said it was up to me. I decided that I wasn’t going to keep this a secret because it was real and I know I’m sane. I remembered reading about how the albino gorilla was a myth/legend in Africa for quite some time until someone finally captured one. Well I’m here to tell you today (and the world) that Bigfoot/Sasquatch is not a myth/legend. The creature/animal really and truly does exist!! After we made our decision, Rochelle went into the gift shop with the kids. I walked to the Park headquarters and reported what I saw to NPS Ranger Beverly. I sat in the chair stunned and then I began to cry. All these emotions that I was stuffing due to the adrenaline began to surface now that my family and I were safe. You don’t know how vulnerable I felt being so far out in the woods without the ability to protect my family in that kind of situation (i.e., no gun). I told the ranger that I was not crazy. I gave her my business card (i.e., I’m a licensed psychologist in private practice). I told her that I have two master’s degrees and one doctorate degree and that I was an intelligent person. I told her that I know what I smelled, heard, and saw. In between the tears and my shaking, I told her that I saw Bigfoot. She believed me! She didn’t think I was crazy. She said that there is a lot about our world that we don’t know and that we are discovering new species all the time. She took my story, Rochelle’s story, and Levi confirmed what the noise sounded like. I was the only one who saw Bigfoot because I had hiked up off the trail high enough to see it. I can’t tell you what it looked like other than it was very tall, looked half-human and half ape, walked upright, and had very dark hair (i.e., a mix of very dark brown and/or black hair). It happened way too quick and all I could think about after I saw it was to get my family the heck out of there. I’ve done some surfing on the internet and what I saw looked a lot like this picture below. Rochelle and I are willing to talk with anyone. We don’t believe that it is right to have this kind of experience and to hide it from the rest of the world. Please feel free to pass this on to anyone you think would be interested in hearing the truth.

BFRO,Oregon,Josephine,8392,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,2002,July,NA,Summer,A,animal,NA,"A friend and I were driving from Vancouver, WA, to Eureka, CA, at about 11.45 pm late in July of 2002. We were lucky enough that the road opened on the same day we planned to travel as it had been closed much of the week before because of the sour biscuit fire. Anyway, we were both alert as we were excited about seeing the effects of the fire and indeed some of it was still burning in isolated pockets all around the road. There was very little traffic that night. I was suprized at first by seeing movement on the left side of the road. My first reaction was hitchhiker? then a millisecond later my brain said ""bear?!.. standing...upright? then another fraction of a second and the creature was in the road in the open right in full view of my high beams. At that time I jokingly said ""There he goes right there"" as I told my friend earlier that bigfoot was supposedly seen in this area before. About the same time my mind was coming to the realization that it was not a bear because it was walking on two feet and my friend started to make this ""hooo hooo!"" kind of sound and pulled his legs up to his chest fetal style. Now I must interject at this point that my friend and I are not easily frightened and also that he is 6'4"" and to pull his legs up to his chest in a Toyota 4Runner is not the easiest of movements. Thats when I was gripped in a fear that I have never known not even when the Cali police have pulled their weapons on me, not when I was surrounded by Yurok indians drunk and pissed off at me and my entire race. But at that moment I was stricken with a fear that I can only say was instinctual as I was not terrified but something deep inside me said"" Get the f... away from here now!"" Please excuse my language but that is as close as I can descibe my feelings at the time. When the fear hit, me my right foot immediately floored the accellerator, not in an attempt to hit the creature but in an attempt to get away from it. That last little bit of info bothers me to say openly as I have always been interested in things that are supposedly mysterious and I am not someone who would ever be called weak-willed. I wish in hind sight that I would have slowed down or even stopped but my instincts took over and all thoughts of interest in the creature were not even in my mind at the time. The creature was at least seven feet tall, more like eight feet, as it was a full foot taller than my 4x4. I am in construction by trade and I am fairly adept at estimating sizes as I have to do it all the time. It was covered in fur/hair medium to dark brown. Long arms and legs, with each appendage not having any parts out of proportion with the other parts of the same appendage. Which I mean to say is that the calves were not overly long in comparison to the thighs and so forth. The only time I saw the arm go down it went past its knee and the individual fingers flexed, although I will admit to not getting many details. [My eyes] did get drawn to the shoulder area which was very wide and that's when I noticed something that makes me think it was not a trick or hoax. The muscles in the shoulder areas and between them bulged independently. I could see little muscles under the fur ripple in various ways when it moved like an animal, not at all like a bulky costume or a hide worn by a person that would move in a more uniform and less isolated way. The head was somewhat conial and sat upon a thick short neck. I unfortunately didn't see the face up close so I can supply no clear details. I did get a glimpse of the face when it first hit the road and heard us coming, though. It was too far to detail anything accurate but it was wide with very little in the way distinguishable features. When the creature saw us it seemed to pick up speed but never ran or even trotted, just seemed to increase its pace. Now this thing walked directly in front of my truck at very little distance in full view of my high beams. If this was a trick, someone spent a lot of time, money, expertise, and genius to pull it off on a road that was until a few hours before was closed to all traffic. Not impossible but I dont think so. The most unsettling thing for me (besides the abstract fear) was the way the creature moved - something familiar about it. Now I've seen many shows playing what are supposedly films of bigfoot and how it could be faked. But in these reeactments the fakes are easily seen for what they are. Someone in a suit or with fur covering them trying to move like and ape, which usually turns out very mechanical and almost obvious. This creature moved with extreme fluidity and smoothess. All appendages moved at the same time, head turning, legs moving, arms moving, all with the same fluidity. After the creature moved across the road to the trees on the right side, we both looked at each other and said ""No way!"" with very wide eyes. A few minutes later we came to the first signs of civilization when we passed a Ford Explorer on the side of the road with three firefighters in it. The driver's side doors were both open and I saw the faces of two of them and they looked amazed or shocked. I think they were just a few minutes ahead of us and they may have seen something too or they were the culprits of an very elaborate and expert hoax. If there were any other reports in the area or if it is possible to talk to some of the firefighters fighting the fire in the region I would like to speak to them.

BFRO,Oregon,Josephine,14891,Richard Hucklebridge,2005,NA,NA,Spring,B,vocalization,NA,"I was just browsing Google earth tonight and clicked on some place marks that turned out to be links to your big foot sighting page. The place marks were on the Big Tree loop at the Oregon Caves and it perked my interest because I have ridden my dirt bike through those mountains and made it to the caves from the Applegate Lake side. After reading those reports I think I should share with you guys something that happened to me on the Sturgis Creek trail. Sturgis Creek trail is at the base of mount Elijah which is probably 2 miles to the east of the Oregon Caves. The trail will take you from mount Elijah all the way to the Big Tree loop where you can then walk down to the cave area. The first time I went to the trail was in mid spring of 2005 and I got my truck stuck in the snow. I tried to get it out and decided I should probably walk back down and find a phone unfortunately not knowing that it was 14 miles to the nearest house with a phone. As I started walking down the road something started screaming / howling from the trail head area behind me. I know what mountain lions, wolves and coyotes sound like and this was nothing like that. The only thing I can compare the sound to be the howling I’ve heard in the werewolf movies. It sounded like a deep screaming howl, and it echoed off the valley walls very loudly. It repeated probably seven times, and I was getting really nervous. The most distinctive thing about the sound is it didn’t die out like you hear with wolf and coyote howls, it would end abruptly and start again. Luckily I had my 45 caliber carbine rifle with me and I had the safety off for at least four miles after hearing that. I was pretty freaked for a while. I walked backwards for at least a mile and was constantly watching my back after that. After reading the reports from 2000 in the cave area I think there’s something around there, I just hope I don’t run into it especially if it’s screaming like that.","Sturgis Creek Trail , from Sturgis Ford Road go west then take NFD 1020 to NFD 600",Applegate,"NFD 600, Tail 903",Sturgis Creek Trail,NA,NA,NA,NA,1400,NA,NA,NA,NA,"forest , canves , mountain",NA,yes,NA,NA,402.34,1320.0,440,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,howls,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7 ""werewolf-like"" howls",1,"I.M.

Thinking they were deer, I occasionally follow them. After seeing that deer like to feed in the lawn area, I started putting apples and other fruit out for them. Within the last couple of months I have heard some things at night and when I checked I never saw anything but I always would smell a strong musky odor. The dog would go out barking; I knew he would come back in smelling like a skunk. He always came right back without a smell. When he went out chasing deer, he would always stay out for some time. I started to put fruit out on the table by the house. In the morning it was gone. A couple of nights ago I awoke with the motion sensor light coming on. I smelled that smell but by the time I got to my feet to look out the window all I saw was something large and dark walking on two legs, heading back into the trees. Unfortunately, the creature had moved into the shadows. The ground is solid so I have not been able to see tracks of anything, not even the deer that I do see crossing the property. I smell him almost nightly and continue to try to get a better look at him. I could not honestly tell if it was Bigfoot or a man but from where I saw him he was walking past a pull trailer and he stood with his shoulders well above the top. I am 5'5"" and the trailer is taller then I stand. This is why I THINK I may have a Bigfoot around. I often feel like I am being watched. One last thing. When I first moved here, I had chickens and each night 1 or 2 would end up missing. There where never any feathers around so whatever took them carried them off.

I was so excited to be back home; even the air smells sweeter when I got back. I would get in my car and just drive sometimes. One day, winter of 2006, my daughter and I drove up to the Oregon Caves and then meandered back towards Redwood Highway. I decided to stop at a park on the outskirts of Cave Junction to smoke and stretch my legs. It was winter and nobody else was in the park, very quiet and cold. We walked down to the river, randomly talking about how pretty it was. Out of the corner of my right eye I saw someone walking in the river. My first thought was of concern because it was so cold and I could not imagine anyone being in the river except if there were an emergency. I turned my head and all I remember seeing was a very large dark person (It walked like a human). I don't remember much after that except sheer panic. My hair was standing on end and I yelled at my daughter to ""RUN""!!! I didn't even look back to make sure my daughter was behind me, I figured I could hear her footsteps and that was good enough. All I could think about was whatever that thing was, it wouldn't take long for it to catch up to us before we made it to the car. Once we were in the car I don't even recall how fast we got back to the highway. I stopped in a parking lot once we were in Cave Junction and tried to calm down. We hadn't even spoken to each other until then. My daughter finally asked me, ""Mom, what was that?"" I told her that I had no idea, maybe it was a bear. Her reply was that it didn't look or walk like a bear and it was too big to be a bear. I agreed with her but I didn't have any other answer at that time. I honestly cannot recall a time when I have been that panicked especially considering that there really was no reason to panic. This thing was far enough down river that I could not make out details of its face and it was just ""strolling"" through the water. It was not making threatening movements at all. I had pretty much convinced myself it had to have been a bear and forgot about the incident until recently when I saw a bear while hiking. I have seen bears in the past but this bear was quite close and it didn't really bother me. I just turned around and walked back the way I came in. It occurred to me as odd that being alone, seeing a bear ahead of me (with my car quite far away) I felt no panic and very little fear. I couldn't understand my fear of whatever was walking in the river.

BFRO,Oregon,Josephine,24892,Richard Hucklebridge,2006,August,21,Summer,B,vocalization,NA,"I write this email with a little apprehension of what my son and I heard in late August 2006. My 16 year old son (at the time) and I were on a three day hiking trip in the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon. We were hiking on trail # 900, to a snow shelter cabin we've been going to for about the last 10-12 years at the time. It is called Greyback shelter off of trail #900 or Obrien Creek Trail. The entire area is wilderness and you can reach the Oregon caves from the same main trail # 1207, also called the Siskiyou/Rogue division trail. On the southwest side of the cabin there is a huge meadow where there used to be another cabin built in the 40's by cattlemen. On the third and final morning we woke up in the shelter where we had camped. And, I had to answer natures call, my son was just getting woke up when I told him I would be back in a few minutes. I walked to the meadow where there is an old outhouse type thing just to the back of the old cabin that stood there, and well... After, I had finished, I remember feeling like I was being watched, and I walked toward the path that connected the two cabins in the meadow. The meadow is beautiful, so it being about 8:00 - 8:30 AM, I stood at the base of the meadow to enjoy the scenery. Then, above me I heard a screeching howl/guttural like sound, that lasted a couple of seconds and ended abruptly, and began again, it seemed like it went on for about 2-3 minutes. I stood there looking up to the area I heard the sound and could not see anything, which was weird because it is relatively open meadow with rolls and dips. I didn't recognize the animal making the sound. Like so many of your reports that I have read, I'm a hunter, hiker outdoorsy kind of a guy. And, I had a hard time identifying the sound, still can't. But, it kind of freaked me out I pulled my pistol and quickly, cautiously went to the cabin were my son was, and We never go to mountains without a firearm, He had heard the sound as well, and he had pulled his weapon, he knew it was me coming I was calling him to let him know it was me, as I came around the cabin I saw my son looking in the same direction as I had when we both heard the sound, he was as white as a sheet. We were both very visible shaken. He then asked me ""DAD, what the hell was that?"" I know my son is a teenager, I know he cusses, but not around me at the time. We ate and uneasy breakfast and packed our gear and headed out, a lot earlier than we would normally. All the way down the trail back to my truck we constantly check our back trail, it only being about a mile and half down and out of the area it was probably my longest hike. We have not been back to the cabin since, and that was just over 2 years ago. I would also like to add that the sounds we heard that day are similar to two of your sound clips 1973 Puyallup and the 1978 Snohomish county whoops/ howls. But, with a little more guttural grunt that ended abruptly, it did not taper off like a coyote, fox, wolf or elk; it just stopped and started again. My name is B. H., and I lived in Medford, Oregon. Think what you will of me and my son, but we know what we heard that day and we do not know what made the call.

He described their relative locations as an off-angled pyramid; B.H. located at the left corner of the base, his son located at the right corner of the base (1/4 mile apart), and whatever it was making those strange sounds higher up toward the ridge, about 50 to 60 yards somewhere in front of him and to his right. At first he thought it sounded like a coyote bark, or maybe even a bear making a ""woofing"" sound. He then realized that it was not one of those creatures, but something else all together. He couldn't put the screeching/guttural/howling sounds to anything that he was familiar with; and he has been outdoors for most of his life backpacking and hunting. He thought his son could be in trouble, and he took off in that direction as fast as possible. There were four to five very loud screeching/guttural/howling sounds heard over several minutes. The sounds lasted three to four seconds each time. B.H. decided to go to where his son was located. As he was leaving he heard one last moaning sound. These sounds were also heard by the son, causing him to be concerned. Two days prior, his son (L.H.) found what he thought was a large bed about 300 yards in front and to his left of where B.H. first heard those strange sounds. B.H. never saw this bedding area. The following is a hand-written message from the witness regarding the bedding area, as stated by his son: ""I did talk to my son, L.H., and asked him about that area we talked about. He said it was a large 6 -7 foot radius in and among brush and branches. The bed itself was completely void of any debris, and it was against a large fir tree. He said he could remember where it was, and I've included it with this email. According to L.H. it was approx. 200-300 yards up the meadow and to the left, about 300 yards below the ridge line. And, almost a perfect 45 degrees from the location of the calls or vocalizations we heard. Hope that helps."" Meadow where incident happened. Note: The sounds came from the trees that are located just up and to the left of this witness as he stands in this photo, at about 50 to 60 yards up and behind him. His son's location at the time when the sounds were made was approximately 1/4 mile away, in a straight line to the witness' left. This area is located just a few miles due east of the Oregon Caves, and is close to the Bigfoot Trap that was built in the Siskiyou National Forest in 1974. The witness' directions were very precise, and I found the location as mentioned in the report on my topographical maps.

Several times we heard what sounded like a branch hitting a tree. The sound was the same each time, two cracking sounds spaced about two seconds apart. My wife thinks that the sound may have been heating or cooling of a burnt out tree, cracking as it expands or contracts. We were in the Biscuit fire area. There was not much of a breeze to cause branch movement, so not likely wind.

W.N. seemed very astute and credible in talking about their experiences that occurred to them while on their claim in southern Oregon. On several different occasions while the witness and his wife were spending several days and nights out on their claim last summer, they had the opportunity to hear what the witness believed to be wood on wood knocks close to their camp. The wife tried to justify those sounds as tree embers still cooling down from the ""Biscuit"" fire, but in all reality that fire had long ago been put down due to several years of winter rains. The Biscuit fire was one of the largest in that part of Oregon. This fire burned over 500,000 acres in the area of their claim. He explained to her that the fire had been out for several years and through several winters, so the burned trees could not be making those sounds. What can be added to this report, and was a strange happening, was the fact that during those two days while the wood knocking was taking place, they had several deer come down into their camp and just seemed to hang around; almost close enough to touch, which had never happened to them before. Those burned areas do draw many wild animals after several years, especially deer, because of the new growth. Prior to last year's BFRO expedition in southern Oregon, the wife and I had the opportunity to drive up into this area, just checking on locations where our large friends might be hanging out. This area seems to be recuperating very well from that very large ""Biscuit"" fire that occurred several years ago. Please note that this area of Oregon also has a reputation for many Class ""A"" and Class ""B"" encounters in the recent past. The main reason this investigator thinks there is a good possibility the knocking sounds were being made by sasquatches, is the behavior of the deer around the couple.",yes,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=25445
BFRO,Oregon,Josephine,28445,Trace Taber,2010,October,23,Fall,A,animal,NA,"It was about 7:15am and overcast but had just stopped raining. I was hunting near Hugo, Oregon. I was about a half a mile from where I parked my vehicle walking on an ATV trail. It was still mostly dark and I had my flashlight in my hand but turned off. I was trying to be quiet as possible while walking quickly because I wanted to make good time to a favorite clearing without spooking any deer that may be in the area. As I was walking, I saw a very large animal walking upright in front of me across the trail at about 10 yards. It didn't appear to be running but expanded the distance of about 15-20 feet in two strides from left to right of the trail. It did so without making any noise that I can remember. I instantly froze and clicked on the flashlight. What I saw made my hair stand on end. I saw a large muscular dark fur covered animal that looked to be about 7 - 7 1/2 feet tall. I guess it would be around 500 lbs. I have seen a few bears and I know positively that it was not a bear. It was maybe 20 yards away from me and moving quickly down the hillside and into the trees. The entire encounter lasted just a few seconds. I don't believe it looked back at me so I don't know what it's face looked like. I was fixated on it's body.

As he recalled his encounter, he admitted to having ""Goose Bumps"" as he told me what happened. After much questioning, I am able to add the following to his encounter in his own words: ""The ambient light was very low and the only way I even saw it was because I was walking slightly uphill on a ridge and I noticed something very large moving against the clouds. When I turned on the flashlight it was wet with dark brown almost black fur. When it walked, it's legs were bent, torso was slightly hunched over and its body seemed to kind of glide and didn't bounce like people do. Its arms were long, to the side of its body and swung like a person. I don't really remember what its hands looked like sorry. I have no idea if it was male or female or how old it was. It was just big and muscular with a big rear end. Its head looked like it was sitting almost directly on it's shoulders. I want to say its head looked pointy but I'm not positive. There is one more thing that I'd like to add that I forgot to say. I had a camera with me but the encounter was so short lived that even if I had remembered the camera, there is no way I could have taken a picture. I use to think with all the digital cameras out there that Sasquatch couldn't exist because there would be tons of pictures but now I can see why that isn't true."" The witness stated to me he watched the Bigfoot cover 25 or so yards in less that 5 seconds but noted it didn't seem to be in a hurry. He was an avid non-believer prior to this encounter,having spent a great deal of time in the woods and not had any similar experiences. He has now changed his mind and stated he will see the area where he hunts deer in a whole new light from now on.

BFRO,Oregon,Klamath,681,NA,1980,October,3,Fall,B,activity,NA,"My brother and I were spending the night in our grandparents' camp trailer, which sat about 20 yards away from our parents' house. We were staying there because our other set of grandparents were borrowing our bedrooms in the house for the evening as guests. Initially, my dad escorted the two of us out to the trailer and tucked us in. He locked the door as he left. That was at about 10:00 p.m., maybe 11:00 p.m. As my dad left, I turned on the light so that I could look at a book that I checked out at school that day. I laid there in bed and looked through the book. My brother was laying directly to the left of me in his sleeping bag. I was reading the book for about an hour when I noticed peculiar footsteps outside of the trailer. The footsteps were deep-sounding thuds like deer make in the woods. I used to hunt, so I was familiar with ""deer sounds"". There were always a lot of deer around our house in the night, so I paid it no mind at first. I was just thinking deer were walking around the trailer and on the lawn which surrounded the house. I continued to look through my book for maybe 15 minutes when I realized that the footsteps were not going away and were very close. This started to really creep me out. I reached up to the light and turned it off. At this point, I just listened. The footsteps continued in the vicinity of the trailer. This continued for about 10 minutes after I shut the light out. After this, the horrific started. [At this point, my story is probably going to sound like an unbelievable haunted house story, but you must believe me. After this incident happened, I never spoke of it to anyone outside of the family for years. Recently, I've told my good friends and my wife this story because now days I guess I just don't care if they believe it or not.] I was laying there listening to the footsteps when suddenly I heard what sounded like fingernails or claws gently brushing the side of the trailer and the trailer door. I was petrified. This continued off and on for a half of an hour. The next event was really creepy: The animal outside started to claw at or play with the ceiling vent in the middle and at the top of the trailer. I didn't see anything at first, but then I saw what looked like the silhouette of a long shaggy finger poking through the vent above the metal mesh screen. It reached from one end of the vent to almost the other side. This lasted for only a few seconds, and then the ceiling vent was still and silent. However, the footsteps continued around the trailer for at least an hour more. I figure it was past midnight by this time. During this period, I heard the animal trip over the trailer hitch or something like that. This was confirmed by the ping of reverberating metal. The animal continued to stay within the vicinity of the trailer after midnight. What happened next makes me believe that this animal was probably a Bigfoot. At this point, I heard a car turn off the main paved road and up our subdivision's dirt road (about a quarter mile away). As the vehicle closed on our location, the creature sprinted directly towards what sounded like an eastern direction. What I heard was deep, coherent, bipedal footsteps. This creature was very heavy, but bipedal. As it turned out, the car coming up the road turned into our neighbor's driveway. It was indeed our neighbors, and they appeared to have just come from a party by the way they were talking. They were only mere feet from my brother and I, but we were so scared that we couldn't move or yell for help. Our neighbors went into their house, and I continued to listen for the animal. I could hear the thing walking probably a hundred yards away out in the forest and sagebrush, but it appeared to be keeping its distance. I could hear the distinct bipedal footsteps. The creature did this for a couple of hours, and I was starting to feel as if it were getting safer. I went to sleep finally. However, sometime later I was awakened by the sound of something literally punching or hitting the trailer. I heard the footsteps again up close. The animal was back. It walked around the trailer as it did earlier and then it appeared to go away and I went back to sleep. During the entire event, my brother and I did not move a muscle or even say a word to each other. The next day, we stayed in that trailer until my dad finally came looking for us at 11:00 a.m. We were two frightened boys.",private residence in subdivision 15 miles south of Klamath Falls,Keno,Ken-Worden Road,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2400,NA,NA,waning crescent,27,forest,"pine trees , juniper trees",NA,NA,120,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,shaggy finger,NA,"walking around trailer , messing with vent , scartching trilaer sides",NA,NA,bipedal,whistles,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=681

I was with my parents and sister on a camping trip somewhere south of Crater Lake. It was around 9:00 p.m. and had been dark for at least an hour. We all went to bed; my parents slept in the trailer and my sister slept in the camper and I got to sleep in the tent. We had all got in our spots with the tent about 15 feet from the trailer. I crawled in my sleeping bag and could here my parents voices but couldn't understand what they were saying. I could also hear a couple twigs snap. At first I thought it was a squirrel but then I thought; they aren't out at night. The terrain is flat with small pine cones and tons of pine needles covering the ground. We were the farthest campground out and national forest all around. The closest campsite to ours was about 60 yards away and there was one guy in it and he had a great big bon fire going. I saw him right before I went in the tent and could here him banging some pots or pans now and then. So this noise was getting closer. It wasn't very loud but I could make out actual footsteps. It was coming from the wooded side of the tent. This tent is a 9x12 with about 5ft. walls. I could still hear my parents and knew it wasn't the guy in the next camp site. It was at the back of the tent and it was coming around towards the front. In the corner of the tent I could see the glow from the bon fire. I was looking at the glow because that is the only bit of light that I could see anything. I could make out this outline shadow and it was human like but could only see from about the chest down. It was very quiet and purposeful in it's walking. It bumped the corner of the tent and and the whole tent shook. It seemed to stop right in the fire glow and stare at the tent as if to wonder why it shook. I would think that if it was a man, that when it bumped the tent that it would have acted different than just staring at it. It was now walking around to the front of the tent which the zipper was right next to the pavement in which I would not be able to hear it walk anymore; which in fact I didn't.

At the shore I fished for awhile when the wind briefly changed direction, blowing off shore. As the wind changed I noticed a very foul smell. I remember thinking that there must be something dead in the willow thicket about 10' on the otherside of the trail from where I was standing on the lake shore. This smell was followed shortly by a sound like something hitting a tree with a large rock or branch. This was followed awhile later by what I passed off as a bird, but it was not like a sound made by a bird, more like a high pitched howling.

After stopping at Cougar Springs, we headed up to Proxy Falls area and hiked into the Three Sisters Wilderness area about three miles. We had just entered a meadow about twenty yards wide and stopped to talk when we both heard something that sounded large moving in the trees just outside the clearing. We both started listening. Whatever was in the trees was making a low, soft grunting sound and it's footsteps were audible and heavy. It sounded like a biped. My wife asked me what it was but I had never heard something make that sound before. I grew up about 40 miles from this spot in the upper Santiam River area. Whatever it was completely circled us, staying in the trees, twice. We were both becoming uneasy, and my wife asked me to get us out of there. We began to walk back down the trail, stopping occasionally to see if it was following.

They immediately left the trail from Proxy Falls to pick their way along game trails traveling approximately three miles and stepped into a clearing about twenty yards wide. The animal initially crashed through some brush and he thought it might be an elk until it began to grunt. The grunting was a very low, soft, odd warbling. The animal made this sound as it circled the couple twice. The animal could be heard occasionally popping brush. Approximately 10 minutes passed from the time they noticed the animal until they decided to leave. The decision to get out of there was more instinctual than thought out. All he could think about was the safety of his car. He stated at first they walked, afraid of being chased and stopped one hundred yards away to listen. They could still hear the animal popping brush so they picked up their pace until they reached their car. He is familiar with the fauna of the area and has had experiences with bear, cougar, etc. of which he said, ” I’m cautious, but not afraid when around bear, or cougar, but this thing really spooked me.” He stated that it would be unusual behavior for a bear and added that he and his wife were not carrying any food. They discussed the possibility that it was a Bigfoot on the way back to their car. The McKenzie Highway O-242 just east of Proxy Falls is closed for all but five months of the year and generally not open until mid-July The terrain of the Three Sisters Wilderness is rough, being formed by a lava flow. Many small bodies of water can be found and few people pass through this area during the very short three to four months it is accessible. There are no roads into the heart of the wilderness area.

BFRO,Oregon,Lane,10977,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1978,December,18,Winter,A,animal,NA,"This sequence of events occurred in December 1978, a few days before Christmas. The location was at the edge of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area near Cleawox Lake, about half a mile west of the Coast Highway 101 across from the Jessie M. Honeyman Memorial State Park. The air was slightly hazy but brightly illuminated by a waning moon between full and third quarter. The observer with her German Shepherd dog had been walking in the beautiful night, very warmly dressed, as was her habit. She had been standing quietly on a high spot with trees in the ridged terrain covered with beach grass and intermittent impenetrable thickets, at about 1 AM, when she observed the silhouette of what she thought was a man approaching in her direction from the north about 400 yards away. This person was walking on an elevated ridge that projected him against the skyline, the north-south ridge oriented running past her to the west. Throughout the entire pacing sequence she could see light through the legs. Not wanting to have an encounter at that hour with anybody, she retreated below the ridgeline and sat down in a concealed and dark hollow with her dog. As the “person” got closer at a brisk pace, the dog bolted towards it, barking and with its running start ran to the top of the ridge about 500’ ahead of the figure. There the dog immediately made several “yaiyeeee - yaiyeee” distress calls and ran back to the observer, huddling close to her and shivering. It should be mentioned here, that the dog had lived in Alaska and had had encounters with moose, bear and other mammals and had never reacted in this manner. The approaching individual seemingly took no notice of the dog, did not break stride or slow down but kept getting closer with its steady stride. At this stage, it made a left turn and walked directly toward the observer, she observed that the head and shoulders traveled without vertical motion, as if the individual were traveling on cross-country skis. She also observed a distinct “sliding” motion of the feet, which she believes was caused by a peculiar sideways swing of the foot and leg. It came to a stop about 150’ from the observer. It should be added at this juncture that during the entire approach, the creature walked on the anterior half of the foot with a 5’ pace, as ascertained by inspection on the next day. It stopped in the exact place where the dog had turned around and faced in the direction the dog had run. The hooded observer shielded her face with her gloved hands and hood to be less visible. After several minutes with no motion on either side, the “person” got progressively smaller until only a lump remained visible. The observer contemplated whether the “person” was receding but decided that it was simply hunkering down and watching. After a while, in fact, the figure stood back up and seemed to hold both of its hands beside its head, perhaps cupping its ears to hear better in the prevailing brisk wind from its rear (from the west). It then started walking more slowly toward the observer, taking 3’ steps (as verified later). During this approach it swayed dramatically from side to side. The observer now also noticed that the creature was evidently naked by its silhouetted legs clearly outlined up to its crotch. Its legs turned out in a peculiar manner during each step but each footfall was set exactly in line with the preceding foot, a detail verified later in daylight. At this juncture, she came to the inevitable conclusion that she was observing a non-human individual (Only to be positively confirmed when it subsequently ran). Intermittently, she noticed that the hair on the head and shoulders “bristled” and flared out. She could now estimate that its height was between 8’ and 9’. During the walking and standing phase, light was always visible between its long legs which were rather slender in front view, but thicker when seen from the side. Upper and lower legs seemed of normal relative proportions, but longer than human proportions in reference to the upper body. In face-on view, the individual had a huge head and masssive shoulders, no visible neck, with a peak to the head and backpack-like hump on the shoulders, long arms with hands hanging clear of the torso to either side almost to the knees and a narrow waist. The hair on the peak of its head occasionally flared up and was additionally ruffled by the wind. After some time, after the creature had held its hands again to its head (ears), it suddenly dropped low down and then launched itself with a powerful push-off off the side of the ridge, about 10' high, into an instant high-speed run, in which it covered 95’ to concealment in three 30’ steps, with the legs straight out in front and back, giving the impression of a different hip articulation than that of man. [The human record for the corresponding effort, the triple jump, is just over 60’] To this point about 30 minutes had elapsed. The creature appeared to run at an angle toward the observer rather than away, perhaps to circle to the downwind side. The dog was shivering violently at this time, when the observer decided to show herself on top of the ridge behind her, where she stood for a moment waving her walking stick demonstratively in the air, while the dog pressed against her legs. Then she forced herself to walk, fighting the inclination to run, the half mile or so back to the parking lot and her car, where she and her dog sat with open windows. The dog would intermittently look in one direction or the other and woof slightly. At this point the hidden creature let out two intense, loud and powerful screams, a sound “paralyzing” in its intensity and beyond comparison to anything else. Thereafter, it appeared to be gone and the dog fell asleep. The next morning the observer surveyed the scene of the previous night and made additional observations. The approach of the creature along the ridge top was shown by half footprints, 8-9” wide, with a step length of about 5’4”, in a straight line without stradle. The width of the foot would indicate a foot length of between 18” and 20”, in turn commensurate with a height above 8’, in congruence with the observer’s estimate. The uniform walking on the front part of the foot suggests that the animal was using a “stealth” walking, undoubtedly having detected the observer early on as she had seen its approach. The footprints were not particularly deeply imprinted, in keeping with the rather slender-waisted and thin-legged appearance observed during the night.",edge of Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area west of Hwy 101 across from the Jessue M.

We were heading south and then west when we stumbled onto Kitson Springs, a deserted place when we arrived. We basically threw our sleeping bags on the ground and went to sleep. In no more than 10 minutes we heard loud rustling by the spring about 20 yards away, then a series of loud stomping, then a blood curdling shrieking and howling that lasted nearly 20 minutes. If you are familiar with the Puyallup tape from 1974, this will give you an example of what we heard. We could not see the creature. I had to cover my ears and my two companions panicked, so I told them to play dead. We were scared stiff anyway. I whispered to my sister, the vet, if she thought it could be a cougar which she thought was ridiculous. She suggested it sounded apelike.

BFRO,Oregon,Lane,3200,NA,1983-1984,August,NA,Summer,B,vocalization,NA,"I was staying the summer with an older cousin and his wife in the summer of 1983 or 1984. I was 13 or 14 at the time. They lived in the mountains somewhere out of Elmira(not sure of the exact spelling but it is close to Eugene). My cousin and his wife were new to Oregon; they had recently moved there from Bakersfield CA. My cousin was wanting to do some scouting as deer season was soon coming up, so one morning we packed a lunch and headed out into the forest from his house. In this area there was only one paved road and in the direction we headed there was only one dirt road that soon ended. There was a fairly good hiking trail that we traveled on for maybe an hour and a half then we came apon a smaller less-traveled path that we stayed on for a good 45 minutes, stopping now and again on the edge of small clearings. The forest became to thick to see very far at all. So we decided to try and make our way up onto the side of a mountain we had been traveling at the base of. After about 30 40 minutes of dead-end game trails we had gotten high enough that the forest started to thin a bit. We came to a small clearing that gave us a slight view of the valley below. We decided that we had gone far enough and decided to stop there and eat before turning back. It wasn't but just a moment after getting our food out and sitting back on an old log that we herd some rustling and snapping of twigs what seemed like just out of our sight in the dense forest. By the sound of the twigs we both knew this couldn't be a rabbit or any small animal. My cousin instantly turned and whispered BEAR. We were still for about 1 minute, then came identical noises from the opposite side of the clearing. This really confussed me as the sound were rather loud and I didn't see how it could have moved to the other side of the clearing without us hearing. My cousin then whispered TWO BEARS. He then whispered ""They smell the food."" Just then there was a loud snap in the area of the second noises. Another the thing that was most frightening was the loudness of cracking. I thought this is one huge bear. Over the next 2 minutes I was terrified as the snapping and breaking of what must have been large branches changed position around the clearing never did the noise come simultaniously from the same spot. Not untill I heard the shot did I see my cousin with a snub nose .38 pointed into the air. As soon as he fired there came a loud powerful roar that started low in pitch and ended very high (not shrill). It was a warning I will never forget. As soon as this powerful yell,scream,bellow,??? ended we were on our feet running in the direction we had come from. After about 50 yards to our horror there came another yell and I was sure this thing was following us. We began running full speed. I instantly started getting scratched and stuck by the thick forest. We were running downhill and at about 150- 200 yards there was it again screamed. It seemed so close but we never saw anything: no movement, shadow, shape --nothing. We were now running as fast as we possibly could not on paths. I can only describe it as reckless abandon. Several times I lost my feet and rolled and dove through ferns, trees and thorny bushes. I became separated from my cousin but never slowed up as this scream would repeat approx every 20 seconds. Once back on the trail, my cousin emerged about 50 feet from me. We still ran for what must have been a mile before this thing let up and started giving us some distance. But every time we started to stop or even slow it would yell as if to say, ""Not yet -- get going."" It was the tiredest I had ever been. My lungs throat were were way past hurting. I was so tired I was dizzy. I felt as if I would pass out any moment. We made it back to the house where his wife waited at the door, having heard the shots and screams. I was ripped to shreds from the forest. My cousin refused to believe it was something like bigfoot although he knew it was no bear. He thought it was some pissed off crazy mountain man. I knew not there wasn't a man alive that could have kept up with us,let alone make that noise. I only went outside 2 more times in the next week I was there, once to go to the library and then to the train home. We went to the library to research what this could have been.

BFRO,Oregon,Lane,5529,NA,1984,August,17,Summer,A,animal,NA,"On the afternoon of August 17, 1984, about 3 or 4 pm, my (now ex)wife and I were leisurely riding our Vespa motor scooter in the woods on Fairview Mtn. Road, near Yachats on the Central Oregon Coast. We had been coasting downhill for a minute or two with the engine shut off, so it was very quiet. We pulled over off the road to look at the nice view of the horizon. The weather was clear and warm. Our visibility was excellent. At that point we noticed movement about 100 yards slightly downhill on the far side of the clearcut. A large brown creature got up off the ground, looked at us, and started walking down the hill along the treeline, looking at us a few more times. It walked about 20 seconds and maybe 150 feet directly in our view before it stepped up on a 4 foot tall bank, parted the brush and entered the forest. Along the way, it walked behind and close to a stump, and about 1/3 of its body was visible above the stump from our point of view. The creature walked upright, had a flat face, unlike a bear, a flat chest, and it swung its arms as it walked, very much like humans do. It was too far away to identify the features of the face, but we could tell the top of the head was covered with hair and there was a mane of heavier hair on it's back and shoulders. The body was large and bulky. It did not run, but moved fairly quickly with long strides. When it went into the brush, I said, ""let's go down there!"" And she said, ""let's get the hell out of here!"" So we compromised and waited 15 minutes before we went down to take a look. We found the circle where it was napping, round and about 7 feet in diameter. The dry grass was matted down. The foot prints away were about 20 inches long and about 7 feet heel to heel. The ground was too dry to make a detailed print, but the imprint was clearly there, and it indented the ground about an inch to inch and a half. We did not notice any smell like some people report. The stump it walked behind was about 6.5 feet tall. We guessed that accounting for the slope and difference in our elevation from the creature, that it might have been about 8 or 8.5 feet tall, because about 1/3 of its body was above the stump from our view.",east of Hwy 101 on Fairview Mountain Rd. 10-12 miles,Yachats,Fairview Mountain Road,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1530,warm,clear,waning gibbous,72,"forest , clearcuts",fir trees,NA,NA,0.3,91.44,300.0,100,NA,1,8.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,brown,NA,NA,NA,NA,flat,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,bulky,NA,NA,"""heavier"" hair on back and shoulder",NA,sleeping on ground then got up and walked away,yes,"quick walk , swinging arms as it walked",bipedal,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,20,NA,NA,1.25,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,NA,the spot where it was laying was round and about 7 feet in diameter,2,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=5529

This was in 1992 or 1993 I belive in August.We setup camp anf then hiked around until evening then came back and made dinner. After dinner it was dark so we went up to lookout tower which besides Bohemia Mountain itself was the highest peak about 6000 ft. there was a meteior shower that weekend and we went up to watch it. We stayed up there till about 21:00 I think and then went back to our camp. We stayed up for about half of an hour then went to bed. We had a 3 man tent to sleep in. At about 22:00-23:00 I was just about to fall asleep when I started hearing branches breaking like something walking through the woods towards us. It started a ways away from our camp and kept getting closer. My cousin was calling my name and asking me if I had heard the sounds but I was consentrating on listening to them and to scared to answer him so I just lay there like I was asleep. we had taken his car up there and we parked it about 100 ft. away from our tent because there was to many branches and stuff to drive it all the way up to the tent. The noises stopped and all the sudden there was high pitched and fast "" Woop, Woop, Woop"" thatfrom about where his car was parked. My cousin asked what that noise was and said nothing because it scared me to death. Then it started walking our way and we just layed there and listened and it got closer and closer to our tent until it came about a couple of ft. away. We were so scared we layed there and didnt move a mustle because whatever it was had been walking on two feet not four. It stopped making noise a couple of ft away and we couldnt hear any walking until we could here it was right next tot he tent it had snuck up real quiet we could hear it breathing, when my cousin moved a leg it scared whatever was outside our tent and it took off running and we could hear the individual steps that hit the ground like thunder. It sounded very heavy. It ran off about 50 ft. and stopped. Then it would start walking back towards us, got within about 10 ft. then we couldnt hear it anymore. Then all the sudden it was right next to the tent. It had snuck up real quiet again to our tent: it could move very quiet when it chose to, it move from one side of the tent to the other quietly and fast, it would beon one side and then the other before we new it. It did this pretty much all night. It had left once then came back. finally we fell asleep off and on. In the morning we looked for tracks but there was to much forest litter to see any. we did not have any protection with us at the time and I have never been so scared in my life. I have believed in Sasquatch pretty much all my life, my cousin and I go up there a couple of times a year to look for evidence and hope to have another encounter, but have not. I have hunted since I was a little boy with my father and continue to hunt today and I know the sounds deer, elk and other four legged creatures make when walking and this creature definetly was walking on two legs. Deer usually visit our camp when we go up there and we can hear them coming in the dark, they get close and we can see them in the flashlight. I have read other accounts in books after ours and have found a few simulaitys, like the heavy footsteps when it ran, the "" Woop, Woop, Woop"" we heard is also in Roosevelts account I believe as well as others.

It looked like he lit about a half gallon of Coleman fuel in his fire pit. The flames were probably 6 feet tall. We did not see or hear anything else that night. The next day I walked around and looked for signs of the animal. I walked around the other camp and did not see anything.

While working for the Willamette Natl Forest a few years ago, he became well acquainted with the upper McKenzie River watershed, Mount Washington and Three Sisters Wilderness Areas. Since I also know the area, it is relatively easy to determine his topographical knowledge of the region. R.L. is early 50's, a woodsman/forester, who enjoys cross-country trekking through wilderness using a compass, and not using established or mapped trails. After talking with R.L. for some 30 minutes and based on the witness' descriptions, it is my view that his report describes a real sighting. R.L. does not want to involve the press in this incident. He seems to be a cautious person. Following are highlights from my notes during our conversation this evening: I asked R.L. to describe what he saw of the animal. He had hiked over Boulder Creek ridge from the road and broken into the high lakes country of the Mount Washington Wilderness. The wind was apparently blowing from the east across his path toward the west in the middle of a cloudy day. On this wind he smelled a bad odor that really caught his attention. Stopped and looked around up-wind, and there some 20 feet away stood an eight-foot upright creature in about 4 ft of brush against the edge of a darker fir forest. He said the creature was too close for comfort. R.L. described the animal as having huge wide shoulders, long arms, covered all over with 4 to 6 inch long reddish-brown dark hair. Emphasized dark almost black coloration with reddish highlights. The face appeared dark, eyes not really seen but appeared dark and covered with the long hair. R.L. referred to drawings he had seen of prehistoric man, saying the creature looked similar only with a bigger chest and shoulders completely covered with the long hair. Again emphasized the idea of long hair covering the entire body, head, limbs not a furry or soft appearance. As soon as R.L. turned his head and body to look more closely, the animal turned while looking at him and bolted over a small hill covered by lava pumice soil and stone disappearing into forest and understory cover. The entire viewing encounter happened in less than 5 seconds. I asked if he could have taken a photo. He said cameras were not something he carried while trekking. Usually carried only a knife, compass, and water bottle. The encounter was very quick. The creature disappeared in a couple of quick strides. Because of the pungent dead smell and startled viewing, R.L. became frightened. He said, ""The animal went east, I went west leaving the area making my way back to my truck."" I asked R.L. if he is interested in returning to the area. He said not alone but agreed to go with me sometime soon to look for sign and possibly see the creature again. He does need coaxing. I explained the value of hard evidence such as photos, recordings, accurate descriptions. Asked him to make a series of simple notes for everything he can remember and do it soon, since it has already been over a week. I asked if he knew of other recent sightings in the Pacific Northwest. Quizzed him a little, he apparently knew nothing of the Oregon Caves or Hoh Reservation incidents recently reported in the press. Other responses to me indicated that he was not previously aware of the BFRO web site until he looked up bigfoot information on the web following his encounter.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=673

BFRO,Oregon,Lane,36505,Geoff Robinson,2012,September,19,Fall,B,wood knock,NA,"My partner and I were bow hunting for elk just outside of the major power lines running down the North Fork of the Siuslaw River. He set up to call elk under the power lines just in the brush from the open field area and I proceeded up the road as it enters the forest to set up at a creek area the road crossed. As I approached my set up point, I could clearly hear a very loud knocking. It was not patterned but was like a sound I have never heard in my 30 years of hunting in Oregon forests. It sounded very distinctly of stone, possibly an enormous piece of wood but I really have decided it had to be stone, on a very hard substance of some sort, like a solid piece of wood. This knocking had to be less than 75 yards from where I was. It would continue in small groups, like 3 to 4 knocks, pause, then follow up between 10 and 20 seconds with 1 or 2 more knocks, silence for around a minute and go again. This went on long enough that I was seriously starting to think a person might be up there, but we were behind a locked gate with no other cars parked there and there is just no way anyone could walk through the forest from the other side. It is like miles and miles of timber and undergrowth to I don't even know where to get to where I was. I would estimate this continued for 15-20 minutes, and a good 10 or so was while my partner was performing regular cow calls. He had to be approximately 150 yards+ from where I estimated the knocking. Then he used an elk call referred to as a hoochie mama, and the knocking just stopped. The call didn't go off right and even I was thinking it sounded way wrong. Then I thought I could hear something moving through the brush towards the call. I never saw the brush move or anything, but I could hear a very clear movement of something trying to be quiet. No real twigs snapping or anything just a sound of brush/undergrowth rustling. About 15 minutes after the knocking stopped, I started moving up the road quietly towards the rustling to make sure I was in bow range. I had dismissed the knocking and was thinking elk coming to the call at this stage. I set up 3 different times along the road, hugging the brush in my camo to help conceal me. The third set up was more in the open and I was standing next to a thinner tree. This was about 30 minutes after the knocking stopped. I was straining hard at the brush that would still rustle in approximately the same place like something was stirring but not really moving towards the call any more. Then out of nowhere about 30 yards from my set up there was this super loud knock on the only large tree in that spot. It totally freaked me out. There is no way that was an elk, or bear. I can't decide if this was the same creature that was knocking first and it moved to that area to look for my partner and then spotted me or if the original knocking called up another creature that spotted me as it was moving towards the original knocking. Either way, it was too dark to see my bow sight pins anymore and my partner had moved out of the brush to the road so I quickly crept up the road with an eye towards the brush looking for what made the sound. When I spoke with him, he said he heard some knocks but had dismissed them. When I explained the knocks, he couldn't really come up with any plausible counter explanation.

He wanted to get in a hunt during the last bow season for elk, so was checking food plots out by some power lines with a hunting partner. When he ventured alone close to a creek, he began to hear knocking and dismissed the sound to himself as campers driving tent stakes. As he listened further and the knocks increased in volume and intensity, he became puzzled - this was not someone pitching camp. When his partner let loose a cow call to lure bull elk, the knocking stopped. When the witness continued to walk the treeline, he could hear footfalls in the woods mirroring his movement. When he would stop, the movement would stop. When he walked, he would hear the movement in the woods continue. At this point it was getting dark and the witness began to suspect he was dealing with a bear. He began to walk toward the road hoping to get more in the clear because with the light situation, his range with the bow was about 25 feet.

She is a nurse and has spent much time in both agricultural and forest settings. She has spent time around farm animals and is comfortable identifying deer, bear, elk, and other large forest animals… as well as cattle, horses, llamas, and other large farm animals. At approximately 11 am on Wednesday January 20th, the witness observed a large black hairy object in a cow pasture she was passing. She assumed this was an animal. The witness described the animal as broader than the back end of a cow, but not as wide as one. She couldn’t make out any arms, legs, or head and determined that it was far too large to be a bear. The witness described it as looking like a large burned-out hairy tree stump. The witness does not know what she saw, but indicated that if it were a bigfoot, she assumed it would have been hunched over and facing the other direction. She estimated the animal to be approximately 5 ½ feet tall and 4 to 5 feet wide. The animal’s hair was long and dark. The animal was still during the observation and did not move at all. The witness first saw the hairy object/animal as she passed the adjacent farm house and slowed her car to get a better look. She indicated that she would have gone even slower or maybe even stopped her car and gotten out, except there was pressure to go faster from a car behind her and she was on her way to a doctor's appointment. The witness did not capture a photo. A recreation of the drive was performed and it appears that the witness observed the hairy object for 20 to 25 seconds. At the time of the sighting, the weather was overcast and not rainy nor foggy (the investigator verified that this weather claim is accurate). The witness indicated that she got an excellent look at the object. The animal was approximately 70 yards from the road and 20 yards from the far edge of the pasture. The grass in the pasture was approximately 2 - 4 inches high. The witness passes this farm often and a few weeks later stopped to talk to the property owner. While talking to the property owner, the witness indicated the following. The property owner does own hairy cows, but they were on another part of the property. There were no cows or other animals in that pasture on the day of the sighting. The property owner does not own llamas. The property owner thought the witness’ questions were odd. The property owner did not indicate that any strange animal had ever been seen in the area before. The property owner was not available to be interviewed. The investigator and witness did not enter the property to attempt a recreation of the sighting. The property is adjacent to wilderness and other farms and a light-industrial site. The McKenzie River is at the back of the property so there is plenty of wilderness cover in the area. The investigator concludes that the witness is credible. The object/animal in question is not fully identifiable.

BFRO,Oregon,Linn,686,NA,1994,July,NA,Summer,B,footprint,NA,"While fishing at a large beaver pond about 5 miles east of Gates, Oregon in the summer of 1994, I found a set of strange tracks in the mud along the pond's bank. The tracks came down off a slope behind me, and continued about 15-20 feet out into the water, where it appeared that the animal stopped. The tracks then made a banana loop back toward shore. Because of thick brush, I was not able to continue to follow them. Being a skeptic, I went home without thinking much more about it. I then told my brother-in-law about the tracks the next day, and he asked me to take him to them. Bringing along some plaster, we headed back to the pond. The tracks were still visible, and had even begun to dry in the sun. The tracks measured about 18 inches long and had only four toes. The animal had to be very heavy because the inprint was very deep. We took a cast of the track, and started to head home, when we found a dead, half eaten beaver in the brush. The only thing strange about this was that this was the direction that the tracks had been heading, and it appeared that something big had been in the brush. The beaver had been picked apart, not torn apart, almost like something was looking for the tastiest entrails. My brother-in-law called 1-800-bigfoot,and submitted a report, so I'm sure you have made note of this incident.

I went to get my husband up as he had fallen asleep on the couch that night. I was in the living room and could hear the dogs barking frantically in the back yard which is backed up to a mountain. I opened the window to call the dogs back and heard what ever it was moving along the back side of the yard. It was a definitely a very large animal by the sounds it made while running. I yelled for the dogs and what ever it was stopped and I could hear it breathing. It was a raspy sound and very close. It was too dark to see but Im sure it was stopped looking back at me from a distance of approximately 75ft. It then ran up the hill. By the sounds of its running I'm convinced it was on two legs, not four and that scream was nothing I had ever heard before or ever want to hear again. My family has been hunting my whole life I know what a cougar sounds like and a bear and elk and what I heard that night was none of those.

I visited with both men at the site where they offered to take me, some 40 miles (approx 1.5 hours) from the nearest town. They had camped without campfire on the moonlit night of August 31, 2012 in a remote site together in their tent in anticipation of an early morning hunt. They continued to remind me that this was an extremely unusual event for them, as they had spent most of their lives being very comfortable in the woods, and were pretty horrified from their experience. The father and son described the encounter occurring between 11:30 PM and approximately 4 AM. At about 11:30, the father said that he was awakened by what he thought was the sound of “footsteps” and attributed the sound to a “deer or elk, or bear” and went back to sleep. Later while the father slept, the son who had not fallen asleep so far that night, observed a large hand pressing on the tent, as well as hearing vocalizations from the subject closest to the tent that he described as “mumbling” with another subject farther from the tent in the trees. The son said at that point he hid inside his sleeping bag, afraid to look. The father said he was awakened again by footsteps, only this time the sound was in the vicinity of his truck, and apparently “someone was rummaging around in the back of his truck.” It was at that time that he noticed his son’s distress, as his son was convulsively shivering from fear, head completely covered within his bag. Both men had to go to the bathroom, so they both deliberated stepping out of the tent for some time, all the while hearing the presence of two bipedal subjects circling the campsite in the forested area outside of the perimeter. They noted that there would be quiet, but when they would begin to talk, they could hear footfalls in the woods, only to go silent when they stopped talking. The father described this experience as similar to his stalking technique where he would shadow elk. Eventually the two men exited the tent to relieve themselves, and while doing so, both men observed large dark silhouetted figures in the tree line and on the road leading to the campsite. The father had brought his flashlight with him, and shined it on the figure in the road. He described an approximately 8-1/2 foot tall upright figure with its head turned away from the light beam. The subject had dark brown, almost black hair, and was holding a very large arm and hand up to shield its eyes from the intensity of the flashlight. After this both men returned to the tent, still believing they were seeing things, and waited while two bipedal subjects continued stalking-type behavior around their campsite. As the witness described in his initial report, they gave up and left the area in a rush. During the entire interview process, both men were shaking and appeared to still be in fear. At one point, the relating of the encounter by the son appeared to be unusually charged with emotion. I video-documented my discussion with them and after numerous repeat views determined that their account of the experience was thorough and factual to the best of their descriptive ability. I examined the surrounding area of woods and the campsite and found no tracks or track way as the area was very dry, rocky, and/or ground covered with forest floor duff.",NA,yes,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=36370

They had left in their vehicle on a provisions run earlier that day. When they returned to camp that evening (approx 9PM) they all three were excited, visibly shaken up, and relating their sighting of a large man-like creature with shaggy, but seemingly well-groomed black hair covering its body. Their story prompted all four of us to head back to the location on this obscure logging road and attempt to gather evidence. They described the speed and agility of the animal as we drove for some 20 minutes to the site. One of the men remarked that during this brief, 4 or 5 second period when the creature was not in cover, it appeared that it ran with such skill that its feet never touched the ground - only stumps and logs in the clear cut. As we arrived at the location of the sighting, I proceeded out ahead of them to the approximate place where the creature went into the woods. The area was dead silent, no animal sounds - including insects, were present. While I investigated the woods edge, I heard the men speaking in excited tones and made my way back to where they were standing by their vehicle. They were remarking that they had seen a large, upright heat signature ""with arms"" behind a tree apparently ""peeking."" The witness handed me the imager and I saw what appeared to be a heat signature very low to the ground, close to a large stump. While the stump had its own heat signature, this other form appeared to be brighter and thus detected as a warmer temperature than the stump. After handing the imager back to the witness, this brighter signature had disappeared. We left the location and headed back to camp. The next day, we visited the site again, and using myself for a scale comparison, the witness estimated the height between 6 and 7 feet. This location has a history of sightings, most notably encounter Report 36370. These hunters have spent most of their life in the woods. Their experiences, including this encounter, has changed their entire outlook on hunting, and being in the outdoors in general.

She was sleeping in a large, wooden floored tent in a room of her own. During the night she was awakened by noise and opened the inner door to the front porch, being separated from it by a full-length screen door. She was wearing a long T-shirt. At the other end of the porch, about 15-20' away, a sasquatch was standing in front of the open cooler door with a 20 lb. piece of meat, that had been brought to camp on the preceding day, clamped under its arm. The light in the cooler illuminated the creature fully and she described it as female with ""normal-sized"" breasts and reddish-brown short fur. She estimated its height to be about 6'6"". The sasquatch looked at her, but neither of them moved. After some, seemingly considerable time Chloe screamed, to which the sasquatch did not react. The men in the tent began to jump out of bed and the sasquatch left with the meat. The men spilled out onto the porch and followed the receding figure with several flashlights. Its foot prints were about 14"" long. The food in the cooler had obviously been searched through, but was left in rather orderly condition. Previously a bear had gotten into the same cooler and had made a mess of its contents.

Although the cooler contained a variety of vegetables and fruits, the sasquatch selected and kept the meat only. The door to the cooler had been opened in normal fashion by the handle rather than torn off bear-fashion. The relaxed response of the sasquatch to the girl brings up the question of whether a sasquatch recognizes a human female as such and responds in a different fashion to her, perhaps as a function of the sex alone or different body language conveyed by women (or children, for that matter. Compare the Yacolt sighting report). I explored this possibility by way of John Green's records. We segregated the sightings into male and female human observers, singles, couples, and groups and indexed them against the length of their encounters. The time difference between male and female encounters with a sasquatch did not differ. On the other hand, it may not mean very much, because John mentioned that his database did not record as to who broke off the encounter. Hence, if there is a systematic difference in the readiness with which human observers, male or female, break off the meeting, then it would tell us nothing about sasquatch behavior, only about that of the observers.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=688
BFRO,Oregon,Marion,2628,NA,1975,NA,NA,Summer,A,animal,NA,"Visual Incident approx mid-seveties in Oregon State Park special campsite area called ""Howard's Creek"". It was the habit of my family and several other families to reserve this campsite for a weekend in the summer. It was an infrquently available campsite, as apparently there was a desire to keep the site pristine and in original natural condition. Howard's Creek does have a forest road that ends at Howard's Creek with a turnaround circular drive aspect at the end of the road and we set up camp in part of this area circled by road. It was a bright Sunday afternoon and all the other families had left for home to be sure the kids would be ready for school. My family stayed behind not feeling we needed to get back so urgently, and decided the 4 of us would go for a walk around the circular road. Almost at the turning point fork we saw what we assumed was a huge bear, walk out from the brush from the right of the road, look our way briefly, then walk fast accross the road and crashed into the brush on the left side. The size of this ""bear"" was frightening, as I and my husband are 6 foot 3 and 6 foot 4 respectively and this animal was much bigger, probably 7 or 8 feet tall at least and very heavily built. Covered with very dark brown fur. Walking upright with arms bent. Frightened, we rushed back to camp not wanting to be prey to some kind of attack from this creature, whom we assumed was loking for leftovers after people had left camp. Estimating distance from where we were to the creature, perhaps 60 to 75 feet in front of us. It was a bright sunny day but also with shade from all the trees there. Near the camp we noticed scratches gouged deep into a tree trunk, but considerably higher than we could reach, and we assumed they were made by the animal we'd assumed was a bear. As soon as we got home, we spoke to the couple next door who had been in the camping party, to ask more about what kind of bears you get in Oregon. We had no knowledge of bears we explained, being from South Africa where there are no bears. I asked if it was a Grizzly, as that as far as I remembered was the biggest bear you got. To our surprise she informed us that no bear was as big as we described, and nor do bears walk on two feet. Had we known that what we saw was really unusual, we'd have probably got a better description by looking more carefully. I do have university training in zoology, but the best I can say is that I saw it from the side, so did not get a good look at the face even though it glanced our way briefly. It must have weighed well over 500 pounds, maybe 800, I don't think more. Hopefully Howard's Creek is a well documented place. I don't know how to find it again. It's south of Orgon possibly closer to ugene. The family nex door to us knew the way and we followed them when we went there. I don't know what year it was, but it had to be mid-seventies: We lived in Oregon 1972 to 1984, and my younger son born Aug 1973 was with us as a toddler or young preschooler.

BFRO,Oregon,Marion,5350,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1977,NA,NA,Summer,B,animal,NA,"I was a Deputy Sheriff for Marion County from 1970 to 1982. In about 1977, I was dispatched to a reported shooting incident on the Little North Fork Rd., East of Salem and northwest of Gates. The incident involved four young men who were college geology students, camping near the old mining town of Jawbone Flats doing some college work. They were at their camp around 10:00 at night when they heard a howling noise coming from the canyon below their camp site. They later heard the sound of a large animal coming up out of the canyon towards the road near their campsite. They had dogs with them that became scared and hid in the tent. One of the men got a rifle out of the tent and they all went onto the road to try and see what the animal was. When the animal got onto the road, they could not see it clearly as the area was only lit by the light of the moon and the camp fire but they could see the basic outline of the animal. They described it as being huge, maybe eight feet tall and standing on two legs. The animal started coming towards them which, of course, scared them and the young man with the gun fired at it several times. The animal stopped and then crossed the road and continued up the canyon on the other side of the road making a lot of noise as it crashed through the brush. I could not see much during the night so returned the next day to examine the area in day light. I found where the animal had walked up out of the canyon and saw several areas where it had stepped in the unconsolidated rocky hill side of rock and shale and made impressions but none sufficient to identify any characteristic. Several trees of two to three inch diameter were pushed over in the direction the animal travelled, up hill. The distance between the foot steps was at least four feet and that was on a steep uphill walk. I did not find any evidence of the animal being hurt by the gun shots as there was no blood or fur found. I tracked the animal up hill for several hundred yards and then lost the trail in a rocky area. I made a report of this incident and it should be on file. It should be noted that these young men were intelligent college students on a study project and when I interviewed them, were extremely scared by the incident and from my experience, I feel they were telling the truth. There was no other motive I could determine why they would make up this story and then call the police.

BFRO,Oregon,Marion,689,Todd M Neiss,1999,June,21,Summer,B,vocalization,NA,"A powerful ""roaring scream"" was heard by Dana and Sharmayne while they were fishing on a dock approximately 150 meters west of the Hoover Campground (located along the south side of Detroit Lake where the Santiam River empties into the lake). The scream emanated from a point along the lake to the west of where the witnesses were fishing. Approximately 30 - 40 seconds later, an unidentified fisherman was seen running away from where the scream had originated. Upon seeing him, the witnesses immediately joined the visibly panicked fisherman on the trail and the three of them continued running until they reached the relative safety of the campground. Once there, they ladies asked, ""Did you hear that scream?"" The shaken fisherman replied, ""Hear it? Whatever that thing is was right next to me!"" After their brief conversation, Dana and Sharmayne quickly struck their camp and drove back to Portland.",Hoover Campground at Detroit Lake,NA,NA,Hoover Campground,44.712237,-122.126005,NA,1705,2030,NA,NA,waxing gibbous,57,"forest , lake , river",ferns,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,scream,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4.166666667,NA,3,"INVESTIGATION: At approximately 11:00 p.m. I received a voicemail-page and, upon retrieving it, listened to Sharmayne asking me to call her at her brother's saying that there was an ""emergency"" that required that I call her back ""immediately."" There was no doubt that she was still traumatized by the ordeal some three hours later. After she relayed the story to me, I asked her if she would be willing to meet me back at the lake the next day so I could do some investigation. She said she would rendezvous with me on the condition that they were out of the area before nightfall. The next day I loaded my car with my camping gear and assorted investigative equipment (video and still cameras, night-vision scope, parabolic microphone, plaster, etc.) and set off to my office to tie up some loose ends before heading out to the lake. I had scheduled to have lunch with Joe B. that day and so when he called to confirm our appointment, I relayed the events of the evening and my plans to follow up on it. Joe asked if I would like some company and I said that I would be more than happy to have him along. We decided to forego lunch and meet at his home in West Linn. There we proceeded to transfer my gear into his truck and shortly thereafter, we were on the road. Upon reaching the lake, we found Sharmayne and Dana waiting for us in the campground as promised. Once introductions were made, we set out to the fishing dock where the event took place a mere 19 hours prior. Once there, the ladies recounted their experience and pointed to where the vocalization had came from. Joe and I began a methodically canvassing the vicinity; Joe choosing to retrace the trail that the fisherman used as an escape route, while I paralleled him some 50 - 75 feet inland. As we scoured the lakeside forest, my attention was drawn to a large disturbance on the ground ahead of me. Upon closer inspection, there appeared what looked to be a spot where the grass was stripped clean as if something very heavy had skidded or pivoted in the trail leaving a fairly fresh divot measuring over a foot across. Glancing to my left, my eye caught what looked like a fecal stool about five feet from the trail. The stool appeared quite fresh and resembled some of the photos I had seen of other purported bigfoot scat. To the untrained eye, it would have been dismissed as a dark splotch of mud. Using a stick, I carefully dug a sample from it and set it on a boulder for later analysis. Returning to the trail, I almost immediately encountered what was obviously an animal bed in a patch of ferns (less than 15 feet from the scat). The bed was very impressive as the ferns were literally crushed flat to the ground. Unlike a deer or elk bed, this bed had the unique dimensions of approximately nine feet in length and four feet in width. Almost simultaneously, Joe was investigating a point along the shoreline which seemed the most likely location of the hapless unidentified fisherman. His rod-holder was still in place where he had abandoned it the night before. Ironically, the bed was located a mere fifty feet from where he was fishing (dove-tailing nicely with the account given earlier…""Whatever that thing is was right next to me!"" I motioned for Joe to join me so he could observe the bed for himself. What impressed us both was the fact that something lying in the four foot tall ferns would be virtually undetectable from just feet away. There also appeared to be a hastily beaten path leading west from the bed and eventually looping south up a steep rocky slope. Joe and I decided we should return to camp to retrieve the cameras and a Zip-Loc baggie to collect the fecal specimen in for later analysis. With the imprint, scat, bed and surrounding area thoroughly documented on both video and still camera formats, we decided to return to camp for the night as daylight was quickly retreating. Once at camp, we fixed dinner and prepared to settle in for the night. We had visited for several hours when I decided to retire around 2 a.m. The night sky was exceptionally clear, so Joe decided to stay up and stargaze for another hour eventually turning in around 3 a.m. At around 3:15 a.m., Joe was jolted awake by a distinct sound of a ""pretty startling"" series of screams off in the distance. He recalled three powerful screams that started fairly low and ended in a crescendo. The first two were approximately 15 seconds in duration followed by a final scream that tapered off in about five seconds. Joe informed me that he attempted to wake me to no avail. Unfortunately, we didn't have a recording device in place before the ""show"" was over. The next morning, we packed up and prepared to head back to Portland. As we were pulling out of the campground, we decided to drive to a point along the road which seemed the most likely place where the creature would have crossed after ascending the slope above it's bed. We discovered a well used animal trail which I traversed until it intersected a fairly new gravel road some 100 feet above the main roadway. Unable to locate any further evidence of tracks, I decided to walk the gravel road out to where it met the main road.I had almost reached the gated intersection when my attention fell upon a rather deep impression approximately six feet up in the soft bank that ran along side the gravel road. Making use of a sturdy branch, I ascended the bank for a closer inspection. Upon reaching the impression, it became obvious that what ever had put them down was bipedal and extremely heavy. Glancing left and right, I became aware that it was only one of a series of tracks which were very deep set into the hillside paralleling the road below. I counted (and filmed) at least a dozen such tracks, each having over a 50"" stride between them. Although they fell short of presenting the quintessential perfect human shaped print, it appeared as if they had been planted by an elephant…the downhill edge of each track buckling and cracking the earth. Unfortunately, the steep incline of the embankment was not conducive for casting purposes. Suffice to say, I know of no recognized animal that could have made such imprints. CONCLUSION: This investigation was ideal in that we were able to get on scene within less than 24 hours. HISTORY: This area falls within the known habitat of these creatures (the Cascade Mountain Range) and has a history of bigfoot events. FOLLOW UP: The fecal specimen was stored on ice and transported in a cooler. It is currently undergoing scientific analysis at an appropriate local facility. Those who have analyzed it so far seem quite impressed with it's condition and abundant parasitic activity. It will be inspected for content (i.e. diet), potential host cells (which can slough off of the intestinal walls) and unique parasites.",yes,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=689

BFRO,Oregon,Marion,11818,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,2003,June,NA,Summer,A,animal,NA,"I believe it was in June of 2003 when I was fishing on the Breitenbush River approximately 4 miles upstream from Detroit, OR. The river flows through a fairly steep gorge at this point. Because of a hip replacement I had less than a year before, I moved very slowly and deliberately down to the river. The weather was clear and the ground dry. The river is approximately 50 ft wide, swift, and could be as deep as 10 feet. I had been fishing for about 15 minutes when I heard a loud branch snap across the river. In retrospect, I would say the snap sounded like a dry 3-inch branch snapping. I placed the sound about 20 feet up the bank. Since I was armed and very immobile with my bad hip, I decided to continue fishing. My thought was that there was a bear or elk in the thick brush. I kept an eye on the other bank but soon lost interest. I then heard a second loud snap similar to the first. Now, whatever it was had my attention. There was something big across the river in the brush. However, I was armed and separated by the river. I continued to fish with my eye on the other side. As I continously scanned the area, I observed what I first thought was a man move from right to left through a clearing near the source of the sound. The sighting lasted only about 3 seconds. There was no sound as ""it"" moved. My actual thought was, ""Oh, there's a man over there."" I then thought, ""Damn', he was one big..."" I was approximately 25 yards away when I saw ""it"". As my mind digested the information I realized that what I saw had the profile of a sasquatch. I remember a barrel chest, no neck, and it was bi-pedal. I climbed back over the hill to my car to drive over to the other side. No way could I cross directly. Approximately one quarter of a mile upstream, I found a place to park and a path. The path along the river was well above the point where I spotted ""it"". Because of my hip, I could not cut through the brush to the river.

BFRO,Oregon,Marion,12156,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,2005,June,21,Summer,B,vocalization,wood knock,"On June 21, 2005, I started a solo bicycle tour from Salem, Oregon that would take me east up into the Mount Hood National Forest, Warm Springs Indian Reservation, Old Mckenzie Pass Hwy just west of Sisters, and then loop back to Salem. On this trip I would have 2 encounters that are up to discussion as to what they were. Let me just start by saying I'm recently a believer in Bigfoot. For several months I've been reading the case histories on the BFRO website, and frankly, I knew that the areas I'd be riding in were prime Bigfoot country. Let me also add that I had no desire to have any kind of Bigfoot encounter because I'm on a bike, I'm alone, I carry no weapon for defense, I'm often camping miles from anywhere, and I scare easily. Well, on Friday June 24th, I was up near Detroit Dam at about 9pm, and was setting up my tent. I was about a 1/2 mile from the boat marina along what's called the upper arm of Detroit Lake, off Hwy 46, which is fed be the Breitenbush River. So its now about 9:45pm, I'm in the tent just listening to the night sounds, like the flow of the water, the leaves blowing a little in the trees, kind of just getting acclimated to where I was camping, when suddenly I hear this tremendous scream that shook me and filled me with dread. It came from about a mile away, sounded a little higher than middle pitched, like a scream a human might produce more so then an animal, but absolutely could not because of its loudness. This scream lasted about 4 to 5 seconds. It reverberated off the mountainsides in the area. What's more creepy is I was aware that a fisherman had reported to the BFRO a while back of an audible encounter. After the trip I looked it up, its #689, and sure enough this scream came from the area of the first report. I was roughly on the Northeast side of Detroit Lake, and Hoover campground is about a mile further east and south of me. Anyway, this is what I heard; it was definitely a scream and not a howl or a whoop, and frankly, if I had not heard recorded Bigfoot sounds previously, I don't think I would of known what to make of it. It was a little like the Puyallup Whoop-Howl of '73, but did not trail off at the end, was even in pitch the whole time, was louder and more like a scream. The second occurence happened on July 3rd. It was about 7:30pm; I was walking my bike along Hwy 242 (Mckenzie Pass Hwy). I was about 7 miles west of Sisters, OR. It was nice clear weather, sunny and early evening. I was walking the bike because I was too tired to ride, and it was too early to make camp. I was noticing how remote this area is. I had passed earlier a primitive campground called Cold Springs, and was 2 miles west of it. I noticed there were no more pull-outs for cars and didn't see anything or anybody up there. A car would pass about every 15 minutes. There were trees on either side of the road. It was a very pleasent walk. Well, all of a sudden I heard 4 knocks come from the woods just to my right about 50 feet away, behind a stand of trees and bushes. At first I thought Bigfoot, having heard wood knocking on the internet; I immediately looked at the road ahead to see if it was up, down or level. Being the bike and gear weighed 80 pounds, I would be able to make my escape only if it was down, and it was. I looked back at the area the knocks came from, and now saw one large bush suddenly shake, and then what sounded like a very low animal-like growl coming from it. At first I thought FLEE, but then thought of reports I'd read on BFRO, how people often filled with terror and ran. So I decided not to do that. I stood there and watched to see what was next, trying to act brave, and stood for about 30 seconds and thought- hell I don't really care what's next, I just wanted out, this ain't gonna be the day I investigate Bigfoot, I actually said to myself - maybe I'd comeback some other day. So I started walking off, and nothing else happened. I camped about 2 miles west from there. I should say to me this did not sound like a woodpecker, which is often high up in the trees, is faster and more in number of strikes, and is higher pitched. What I heard was four knocks, evenly spaced, coming from about ground level, the sound like that of wood on wood. No one was in the area, no development, it being preserved, protected wilderness. So what made that sound?","To reach first location, take Hwy 22 for about 48 miles to Detoit, turn north on Hwy 46 and go 1/2 mile.

BFRO,Oregon,Marion,16624,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,2006,November,13,Fall,B,vocalization,NA,"Nov 13th, 2006: 9:00 pm, dark, rainy and cold. My husband and I had just put our oldest son to bed, and were settling down to watch TV in our living room. My husband heard ""someone"" screaming ""bizarrely"", very loud far off across our lake, so he opened our back sliding door to get a better listen. That was when we both heard a, maybe 3 at a time, organized pattern of what can only be described as roaring screams. We knew immediately they were not human. I had heard the Klamath audio before and this made my hair stand on end because it was exactly the same. This animal was closer, just across a 6 acre or so lake/pond. We heard probably a total of 4, 3-at-a-time, scream patterns. The individual screams were alarmed, but not frantic. It seemed to be almost 'responding' to dogs barking. The 'runs' were all about .5 - 1 second apart. The interval in between patterns was probably 1 minute or so. All was quiet for about 3 minutes and somewhere in the dark across the lake we heard something very, very large and strong tussle successfully with a dog. At the end of the tussle the dog let out a sharp yelp and we heard a thud. At that point we (I flipped out) shut the door, locked all the doors, sawed a serious dowel for our back slider, turned on our kids white noise machines and went to listen from another part of the house. We heard a few more screams but it sounded farther away at this point and then seemed to go away. Whatever tangled with that dog was extremely fast, extremely large and very strong. Based on what we heard, it sounded like the creature must have either approached or walked past a tied up dog. We heard a quiet small scuffle probably as the dog tried to bite it. Then an enormous amount of thudding, bushes rustling, and a loud pained yelp and a thud. All was quiet after that and we heard some quiet splashing in the lake. The splashing could have been disturbed waterfowl, however. It was pitch black and we were looking out our back sliding doorway into the blackness basically just trying to listen when this occurred. The tangle with the dog occurred about 3 minutes after we heard the vocalization pattern. In total, the vocal pattern seemed to be moving slowly from the northwest end of the lake to the northeast end, where we believe the dog incident occured. I have a BS in zoology from the University of Washington and a considerable amount of outdoors experience. I have heard all different types of animal calls, screams, etc... I'm even quite good at discerning the subtle differences between a Beluga whale click and a porpoise call. I have perfect pitch and a well trained ear from years of classical voice training. This was most certainly a primate type call, almost with a Siamang type quality to it. It was most definitely not human, and I'm certain it was not any other animal common around our area (coyote, deer screaming in pain, rabbit, fox, racoon, other). It was extremely similar to the Klamath falls recording only louder and closer, and it scared me more than anything I've ever encountered. My husband and I discussed our observations at length. There is honestly no other explanation for this type of call and activity, though we understand how rare and extraordinary this must be because we live in a settled area near freeways and quite honestly we've never really considered ""bigfoot"" before much more than ""what a neat theory!"" Let me just state again that this was not human. Not even close. Even a human trying to imitate something like that would have had a 'narrower', more nasal sound as a human just doesn't have the head/throat size to accomplish such volume and tone. Further, it had a squeal and roar quality at the same time, like nothing I've ever heard except the various recordings, in particular the Klamath. Also a human scream would have had some identifiable emotion to it (drunk, scared, angry etc...) as humans we're quite good at picking up on tones of other humans. This had none of that. It was entirely foreign to us. Update: this morning as I look through my binoculars across the lake, exactly where we heard the dog tussle incident, the neighbor's canoe dock is destroyed.

The road started to bend south a bit and we came to the first incline and in the headlights of my truck appeared this figure, at first I thought it was some animal that was crossing the road but as we got closer and the lights of the truck became more focused on it, we realized that it was not a common anima! It looked to be about three to four feet tall with the strangest red colored hair covering it's body. But the thing is, it was sitting in the road facing us with one leg straight out and the other leg out to it's right side, and it was trying to push itself up (as if it had been hit by a car). Well, I had to swerve into the other lane to avoid hitting the poor thing! All this took place in about a minute or so. My friend and I never said a word until after it was over a minute or so, I said ""Charlie...did you see that?"" and he replied ""I was'nt going to say nothin' till you said something, but yes! We thought right off of going back but had decided that since it was so small that mother could be near by and we both (being avid hunters )were armed but what we saw was no mule deer or bear or anything else that we had stalked in the past; so we kept driving just to be on the safe side.",NA,Portland,NA,Columbia River Gorge,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,clear,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,3.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,red,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,sitting on road with leg stretched out trying to stand up,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,"Two investigators have talked extensively with Mark M.

BFRO,Oregon,Multnomah,13037,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1970,July,NA,Summer,B,activity,NA,"The Sandy River originates high on the slopes of Mt. Hood, located about 50 miles east of Portland, Oregon. The headwaters are beneath Reid and Sandy Glaciers at 6000 feet in elevation. From there the river flows due west through the Hoodland Corridor. It cascades past the communities of Welches, Brightwood and Sandy, then turns north to enter the Columbia River near Troutdale, which is 10 miles east of Portland, Oregon. The river drops swiftly through rugged canyons. It has deep boulder-studded pools with clean, gray gravel bars often shaded by tall, wet green trees. It is fishable most of the time and fishes well from 700 to 4,000 cfs. Nowhere else in the world does such a wild and scenic steelhead river flow through such a brawling, boulder-strewn, plunge pool mountain stream, supporting an amazingly rich and diverse food chain composed of mammals specifically adapted to their very tumultuous dispositions. It was mid-summer 1970 when this happened. I had returned to Oregon after a two year stint of duty in the Israeli Army as a Border Guard (post '67 war). Weekly, I would drive along the Sandy River to find a new place to target shoot (keeping up my military skills). This one particular day, in a meadow above and east of the Sandy River, I encountered a clump of birch tree saplings (4.5 inches in diameter) snapped off at about the 6 foot level and the tops were made into a family ""nest"" (space for 3 to 4 people)... Nearby I noticed the aroma of death... There was a pile of dead rabbit, neatly gutted. Only their guts had been eaten … The nearby woods were ominously silent for a summer's mid-day. I quickly left the area in search of a nearby Forest Ranger Station. One of the rangers believed my story and accompanied me back to the meadow. He took photos for the other rangers. Both of us became ""Bigfoot"" believers after that day !",Sandy River,Troutdale,Gordon Creek Road,Sandy River,NA,NA,NA,NA,1400,NA,clear,NA,NA,"forest , river",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,possible nest,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"nest could hold 3-4 people , found 6-8 dead rabbits in the area",1,"The witness, on finding the nesting site - only a layer of birch branches (birches are not native to Oregon woods, although aspens often look strikingly similar) piled deeply and compressed, evidently by several animals.

BFRO,Oregon,Multnomah,7789,NA,1979-1980,October,NA,Fall,B,animal,activity,"The story I have to tell is not a single sighting but three events that took place during the fall of 1979 and the winter of the same or the year of 1980. During this time I was working, living as a resident of the Portland Job Corps, which is located on the banks of the Sandy River, which enters the Columbia River at Troutdale, Or. The camp which is about 4.5 miles up the Sandy, I'd say, where the students live and worked at the time. I'm not sure if the camp is still there or not. The Sandy River takes a turn to the south [at the confluence with a small tributary] and goes up into the westside of Mount Hood. This is where the camp is located. The kids or students who lived and worked there were able to cut holes in the fence and play and explore in the woods, which we did. There was a path that led to the place called The Falls, which was about a half mile from the camp where a lot of students would go to hang out party etc. On the way to the camp was a structure the kids had made. I remember one of the people who constructed it. He was Jim Hinkly, an Indian, whom I knew to be a likeable sort of guy. It was nothing more than a framework made of poles or cut trees about three or four inches in diameter, put roughly into a big lean-to, using trees for support, covered with plastic to keep the rain off of us while we sat and smoked chatted etc. This place was used on a daily basises for a couple of weeks or so and every thing was cool till one afternoon, Jim came into the welding shop and told me someone or thing had destroyed the shack. Strange, I thought. So as soon as class was out, I went over to look at it. There was a structure about ten foot deep by about fifteen feet wide, nothing more than trees lashed to the standing trees to make a full roof basically at a slight angle to shed water to the back. The place had a strong smell, very bad, and the place was a wreck. The main trees/poles that formed the roof were broken in two, snapped like toothpicks. I'd personally hung on them many times and they hardly swayed under my weight. Chairs, broken metal, I might add, and the table broken like someone had hit it in the middle of it and broke it. There was hair around the trees also but no one thought to gather; it reddish in colour, about three inches long. The main things were the smell and the fear a person felt when close to the area. I'd say this was in August or September. The next one was probably in October or November. A group of us was out back above the football field at night partying with the full moon. It was cool and foggy, with the fog moving quickly and low to the ground so the moon was seen but the landscape would be changing - sort of a nice night; the hill, a gradual one, was covered with long grass and we were having a good time with lots of noise, carrying on, probably a group of 8-12 kids, me being one. I would have been about 19 at this time, as were most of the others also. The party was going on when all of a sudden the entire group went dead quiet at the same time. We sort of all started looking around at each other and Martin, who was an Alaska Indian, standing next to me, said: ""What is that?"" Through the fog one could see the form of a large biped close to us, about 30-50 yards away, in the fog. We saw it long enough to know it was not a human, too big, too muscular. I'm a hunter, also have been that from the time I was 6, raised in the woods. I know bear, deer, elk etc., none of the above was what we saw. With the fog moving, it was an eerie scene as the thing would be visible, then fade and then show again. The moon was behind it, so it was a shadow that showed up fairly easily when the fast moving fog didn't obscure it from view. Martin said ""Let's go see what it is"". I said, ok, a couple of girls screamed, and we took off toward it and the girls and some of the guys took off the other way. What happened next was interesting. As we were moving toward the spot where we last saw it - briskly, I may add, I in the lead, all of a sudden I couldn't go any futher. My feet wouldn't move and as the fog moved away, it was about the same distance away, looking at us. Martin was close to me and as I turned to look where he was exactly, when we looked again it was gone in the fog. Total time elapsed was only about one to two minutes from the time we first saw it to the time that it was gone. We moved probable only 100 feet before we couldn't go any farther. The third event happened that winter in a snowstorm - a bad snow storm, I might add. The camp had been stranded for about two days and it had been snowing steadily. It was about 7-9pm. I was dorm leader at this time. Two of the students came in the back door and both where white and moving fast. I said: ""What is wrong with you guys?"" One said nothing and another wouldn't say anything, either. Part of my job as dorm leader was to look into things like this so I followed them to their bunks and lockers where I got one - I forget his name - to admit that they were outback smoking on the football field when something scared the hell out of them. Rocky, the other person, wouldn't say much, just was white and scared. The other kept saying something out is there. Me being the fool I am, said ""Bull"" and headed upstairs to get my coat and boots on and headed out into the snow storm to the football field to find out what was up. Too much snow, about waist deep - I'm 6'2"" tall - for a cougar etc. to be wandering around, I thought. So I headed out across the football field, being the brave fool I was. Things were going well until about 20 to 30 yards from the edge of the field, where the physical training stations were located. This camp used to be an FBI training camp, I was told, and it had a track and training stations around the football field and farther down the hill towards the creek where the road and the town of Troutdale sat. As I said, things were going well until about that far from the edge, when I suddenly couldn't go any further forward. It was not that I didn't want to; I couldn't and in the flying snow I kept being drawn to a large clump of blackberry bushes below the situp station. So I stayed there and played with the feeling. I could back up and it went away, I would come forward and it was present. Strange, I thought. I had a feeling about what I was feeling and what created it. No one else wanted to come out and play from the dorm. They thought I was nuts so I stayed for a while and then went back as it was snowing hard. I won't fill out much more of the details below except name and contact info. If you like I'd tell you the same thing I basically told here. A long time has passed and although I still remember it, I don't know where anyone else is or even if the camp is still in operation. This is in response to reading the Locals book which I found quite interesting and it is something else to add to you list of sightings. The one thing I found most interesting was the inability to move any closer in both situations and the definitive line where this happened. Subsonic sound I don't know, but whatever it was it worked quite well.",From I-84 take the Troutdale exit and go up the Sandy River to the Job Corps camp.

I saw the bushes moving and I saw what looked like a very tall, broad, stout, hairy person, almost ape looking, with long dark brown hair. It was rustling through the bushes. The leaves were moving. I looked at it for about two minutes trying to see what it was. Then it disappeared. I was describing what I had just seen to my sister on the phone as it happened. I felt excited and scared. I locked the door and checked for the twelve gage (my husbands gun). I didn't see the Sasquach after that. But once in a while after that, my dogs would bark in that different wimpering way.

The son, Jason, was driving. Conditions were dark, overcast, dry, and calm. Appoximately four miles west of Multnomah Falls, both occupants of the car observed a very tall, two-legged creature crossing the freeway in front of their car, and heading toward the Columbia River which closely parallels the freeway. ***On the return trip from Portland to their home, the witnesses determined that the creature actually crossed at mile marker 29 on west bound side. Appoximately 300-500 feet west of marker. I-84 (Multnomah Falls is at mile marker #31.)*** The driver estimated his speed to be 65-70 mph. He did not swerve and he missed hitting the creature by an estimated two feet. The creature reached the guard rail as they lost sight of it behind their moving auto. The motorists quickly phoned their husband/father on their cell phone and relayed the incident. Husband/father was at home in Idaho, and knowing of the BFRO website he immediately submitted the report to the BFRO. I'm a Portland area researcher and happened to turn on my computer at 10 p.m. not long after the report was submitted. In the report, the husband in Idaho has included the cell phone number of the witnesses in their car, so I was able to reach the witnesses by phone while they were still travelling. I reached them as they were nearing their destination in Hillsboro, OR on Portland's west side. They were still in a very excited state when I spoke to them forty-five minutes after the sighting. I spoke with both witnesses. Being from out of state and having just arrived in the greater Portland area, they wanted to know if we see these things around here all the time. I said I didn't think so. They reiterated the description of what they had seen just as it was stated in the original report. They emphasized that it was very tall (8-9ft), broad in the shoulders but skinny at the waist. it was completely covered in dark brown hair which resembled that of a moose in length and shade. Jason described a rounded, dome-shaped head. He noted the swiftness of it's motion and a swinging of the arms as it crossed the freeway. Neither witness could see any facial features. It ran swiftly and smoothly on two legs and was certainly not a bear. The skinniness and towering height of the creature they observed was particularly remarkable to them. They noticed another car and a truck travelling in their direction a short distance behind them. They did not see these other vehicles react to the creature crossing the roadway. I am quite familiar with this portion of I-84 and the Columbia River Gorge. There have been other such sightings of bigfoots crossing the freeway along this stretch. It is speculated that the bigfoots may be intending to swim across the Columbia River in this general area below Bonneville Dam where the river is narrow and free of development on both banks. I would encourge interested parties to look for fresh tracks on Sand Island in the Columbia River and on the river bank on the Oregon side at the earliest opportunity. The speed with which this report was reported to the BFRO website and then verified by this investigator is most unusual. I was able to interview both witnesses just forty-five minutes after their sighting.

Miles B. was a student in my science class three years ago and received a basic treatment of the bigfoot enigma as part of a classroom presentation on scientific mysteries. As with most students, Miles doubted that such creatures could still exist and he felt that the evidence that had been presented was not compelling. Then, on a recent summer night Miles was out with friends making mischief in the rural fringe of Portland. Their rural road sign stealing escapades were cut short by a terrifying series of events that occurred at very close range. Miles visited me at work soon after to inform me of the details and to offer that they returned to the site several time since and have not seen or heard anything significant (as I would expect). He also informs me that although he laughed at the concept of bigfoot when we discussed the possibility in class years ago, he now has a very different outlook on the matter. Gordon Creek Rd. between Corbett and Aims, Ore. is an area with many past bigfoot sightings, particularly in late summer. Gordon Creek Rd. traverses heavily forested creek drainages in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains on the western slopes of Mt. Hood. This amusing event may suggests that bigfoots are clever enough to perceive the mischievous intentions of a teenaged male and then to display a sense of humor in the way it dispatched the larceny-minded teen. If this is too much anthropomorphizing of the sasquatch, it is still gratifying to know that at least one sasquatch used its considerable powers of intimidation to protect the public's expenditure of tax dollars on rural highway signs. Even more amusing is the fact that Miles, the typical jaded American teenager, has a newfound respect for mysterious nocturnal creatures as a result of having the daylights scared out of him in a manner that he never thought possible. Miles, for one, does not laugh at the possibility of bigfoots any more.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=5053

Earlier today around 6:25 p.m. my brother was driving home (we live between Corbett Or, and Aims Or.) off of Gordon Creek Rd. There is a switch back with a hair pin turn that has a steep climb immediatly after the turn. As he turned the corner approximatly 20-30 yards from his vehicle in a small cluster of trees he saw a large 7-8 ft tall, hairy creature. He said it wasn't human, but resembled a human standing with his right shoulder hidden behind the last of the 3 trees in the cluster. Upon being discovered he said that he immediately turned and ran up the very steep hill with amazing speed. He said his chest was wider than his waist, hairy, with long arms (ape like) and that he saw him from just below the waste up before he turned (the creature turned to his left) and ran up hill. He couldnt believe how fast he was and that he was there for a couple seconds and then he was gone. My brother frantically called me and I told him to go back to where he saw it and mark it out so that I could meet him there with my HD camera and try to find any prints or debris that may have been left behind. Upon returning to the area my brother saw the local sheriff cars nearby. They said that some people down on the river reported a very hairy naked homeless man and they were investigating. He told them that he saw the same thing but that it wasn't a homeless man. He was very detailed in his account and they laughed it off and left. I drove straight home and met my brother at the switch backs where he sighted it. I brought my dog and my camera. I went to the exact same location as he told me and had him recount exactly what happened. I have it all on film. The area is steep and there are fallen trees and lots of shrubs, so it is a little difficult to see any exact markings other then broken branches and trampled ferns. Near the group of trees where he was standing there is a natural spring that runs down the hill. So I searched both sides to try and find any tracks. Im not sure what to really do other than keep my eyes peeled and my camera close. If you feel my brother could be of any help or if you could help him understand what he saw Im sure he would greatly appreciate it. He is pretty shaken up, I had him write down exactly what happend and what he saw and he was a little uncomfortable doing so.

TH arranged to have RH, the witness, meet us at the sighting location on the evening of 8/1/08, less than 24 hours after the encounter. The witness, RH, was slowly driving (about 10 or 15 mph) uphill around a hairpin turn when he noticed the animal in the woods, approximately 60 feet to the left and above him on the hillside. It was standing behind and to the right of a small cluster of trees. The witness says that the creature, noticing that it was exposed, turned 180 degrees to its left and quickly ran up the hill behind where it was standing. Its speed was faster than a normal man could run on flat ground, though the terrain was very steep, uneven and brushy. Immediately after the sighting, RH called his roommate and brother TH, and told him what happened. RH continued to their nearby home, picked up some gear and returned to the sighting location, which is only a few miles from their house. When he arrived back at the sighting location, there were two police cars parked at the turn. RH got out of their vehicle and asked the officers what was going on. The officers said they were responding to a call that stated there was a hairy, naked, homeless man in the woods by the river. RH told the officers that he had seen it too, and it was a bigfoot - not a homeless man. The officers chuckled and paid little attention to RH's claim. The officers soon left the scene. After TH arrived at the scene, the two brothers stayed in the area for a while and videotaped the scene. TH took his dog and went up the hillside and RH stayed closer to the vehicle, being too shaken to explore the area so soon after his encounter. TH went up the hill above where the creature was standing, and found some deep, yet featureless impressions in the thick forest duff. About 75 or 100 yards above the spot where the creature was standing, there was a large washout in the hillside that was a kind of clearing, though there was thick underbrush. When TH arrived at this spot, he was “hit so hard” by an overwhelming “moving and powerful” feeling. TH stated that this feeling gave him “a whole new level of goosebumps”. At that point, his dog took off running downhill back to the vehicle, which TH stated was very strange since his dog always stayed by his side in the woods. They soon left the area and later that evening, TH found the BFRO website and filed a report for his brother. I asked RH to stand on the road at his approximate location - while I stood where the creature was. By doing this, it is estimated that the creature was around 7 feet tall (see photo below). RH described the animal as being very muscular and fit with a thin waist and very broad shoulders, possibly twice as wide as my own. The creature's right shoulder was partially obscured by the tree it was standing near. It was not as hairy as sasquatches are often depicted in drawings, though it was obviously completely covered with dark brown, but not black, hair. Its face wasn't hairy around the eyes, nose and mouth, though it was noted that it had hair on the side of its face like sideburns that turned back down the neck to its shoulders. No details of the eyes nor mouth were noted, but the nose was flattened and broad. Interestingly, it was noted that the creature had a short neck and its head was shaped like a normal human with no sagittal crest. The arms seemed longer than a human's, and swung as it ran uphill. Due to the foliage, no details were noted below the thigh area. I spent many hours at the site, not leaving the location until around 2am in hopes of obtaining thermal footage of the creature. Derek Randles, a tracker and long-time bigfoot investigator, was called in to help look for additional tracks in the area. He brought a hunter friend and we scoured the area for several hours on the morning of 8/2/08. A possible heel impression in a line of large, yet indistinct impressions heading downhill was all that was found on that day. This photograph shows the investigator in the same position as the creature, showing its height.",yes,yes,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=24318
BFRO,Oregon,Polk,24399,Chris Minniear,1982,October,20,Fall,A,animal,NA,"I felt uneasy the entire morning. I felt as if I were being watched. I had left camp alone and heavily armed. My friend and I were on an Elk hunting trip. As I walked through the forest, I found myself looking back over my shoulder for no apparent reason other than feeling like I was being followed. I stopped by the creek to watch the salmon and have a bite to eat. As I was eating I was watching a clear-cut area where the power lines ran down ridge. This clear cut was about seventy-five yards wide and was covered with light colored grass about knee high (2 feet). I glanced down the clear cut just as something large, dark and upright moved across from left to right. It took this thing about ten seconds to cross. It was about two hundred yards away from me. It disappeared into the trees beyond the clear cut. I thought at first it might be another hunter, but dismissed that thought when I thought about the fact that it was all dark colored and didn't appear to be carrying or packing anything. After it crossed, I picked up my rifle and scanned the area where I had last seen it. I saw nothing and put the rifle down and resumed eating. Moments later as I was watching the point where it had disappeared, it came back out. This time it was moving back to where it had first come from (from right to left). I got my scope on it, as it entered the forest again. I had a 9X scope. I was able to determine it was hairy and resembled a large man (est. 8ft tall). I could not make out any facial detail. I'm sure it did not know that I was watching it. I'm a twenty-four year career Army Veteran. At the time I was a Staff Sergeant with twelve years of service. I was trained in survival techniques and as a scout for a number of years; I could determine distance and area details better than most civilian men. This time I kept my scope on the point where I last saw it enter the woods. It came back out only this time it had a partner! The second creature was about half the size of the first. It looked just like the first creature only smaller. With the big one leading, they both crossed the clear cut and disappeared into the forest. I went back to base camp and told my friend about it and he replied with ""that explains why there's not game in the area.” My friend was a retired Green Beret Major. He suggested we pack up and move to a new location far from the one we were in. We made no attempt to track the creatures.

A creek runs parallel to the lines for a short distance then cuts across the clearing. The animal was crossing near to where the power lines cross the creek. The general area is a patchwork of trees and clear cuts. The first animal was over 7’ tall with broad shoulders 400 to 500 pounds. It was “thin and muscular” with a “pipe-like trunk” and it was covered in black hair that was “not long, maybe four inches” that appeared “groomed and shiny.” Although he only saw its face in profile through the scope, he could see some facial skin that also appeared black. It had a pointed head. The animal’s arms were long and the legs appeared like slender human legs. No mammary glands were noted. The animal’s smooth gait was purposeful and its head remained focused forward. The arms swung, but not overly exaggerated; the posture was bent slightly forward. It took five seconds for the animal to cross approximately seventy five yards. He wanted it to be a bear but could not convince himself that it was. “No way it’s a bear.” He thought, “I’m looking at a legend.” The second animal was a smaller version of the first (about half the size) and walked directly behind. His impression was that they were parent and child. He believes that they knew he and his partner were in the area hunting and the adult was being cautious enough to scout ahead before taking the child across the open ground. At no point did the animals look towards him. The witness was “shook up” and having a gun did not make him feel safer. The animals crossed in front of his direction of travel. He was unsure of what to do, so he sat there for over an hour contemplating. He decided to backtrack and take a different route back to camp where he sat with his rifle on his lap until his partner arrived. They left the next morning cutting their hunting trip short by three days. Of interest, an hour prior to his sighting the witness came upon a dozen salmon that were lying on the shore up to ten feet away from the creek. “Eggs were scattered on the ground. Some fish still had eggs in them as I tested. They did not appear to be eaten on, but some heads were crushed as if they were possibly stepped on.”",NA,yes,"interesting there were no breasts yet a young one was present. perhaps the yougn was done feeding from mother and therefore breasts were shrunken. 7 feet tall seems small for a male, espeically the dominant breeding male",NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=24399

BFRO,Oregon,Polk,25907,Scott Taylor,1995,September,15,Fall,B,footprint,activity,"During the evening my friend and I parked at the end of an old alder road behind locked gates to bowhunt for elk. When it started getting dark we decided to circle back to the pick up; we were approx. 2 miles away on the top end of the mountain along the east side of the ridge line. I had forgotten to bring my flashlight so my buddy had to shine his light for both him and I while we walked out. During the walk while we were crossing the top of the ridge we could notice an awful smell; the smell was kind of moldy or musky so we thought it was probably just a bear that had gotten into some swampy skunk cabbage or something similiar. We continued to notice the terrible smell off and on all the way back to the truck. While on the top end of the ridge I managed to step into a very large hole that was in the rocks; somehow I managed to grab onto something to keep myself from falling completely in the hole as it was big enough for me to fall completely in it. If you consider the fact that I'm 6 ft tall and weigh around 210 pounds you had to figure that the hole or cave had to be pretty good sized; unfortunately, since I didn't have a flashlight I couldn't see what it looked like very well and yes, that smell was also present at the time. When we finally got back to the old alder road where our truck was parked, we could still notice the awful smell every now and then; one other thing that we noticed was the very large footprints that had been left in the muddy dirt on the road. Now these footprints were approx. 16 inches long and looked alot like a mans footprint but what had really made us uncomfortable and nervous was the fact that these footprints were directly in our tire tracks that was made from our drive into the area a few hours earlier. As we looked at them we both thought there had to be a logical explaination; we tried to simply write them off as being bear tracks but deep down we both knew that they weren't made by a bear. These tracks were much too large to be a bear track plus, they didn't have the 2 separate pads that a bear track leaves. I've killed 4 black bears, one of which was 6 1/2 ft tall and nothing in the way of tracks ever looked like these tracks did. Both my friend and I have lived here all our lives; we both are avid hunters and are well known in the area for our hunting success. My friend works in the woods and has done so all his life and for that reason alone, we chose to not say anything about this for quite some time. It was only within the last few months that I had told my brother's friend about what had happened and it wasn't too long after that when he happened to run into my buddy and asked to tell him what had happened. He was amazed at how we both were able to recall things that had happened 13 years ago in such detail; I told him that you don't forget something like that because when it happens, it stays with you forever. We never saw anything that night in the way of a live animal but we both felt as if we were being followed or watched the whole time; it made us uneasy, to the point that we left as soon as we could get to the truck. I've been back to that area once or twice but I have never seen anything else although there have been some recent incidents that would indicate that there is indeed something up there. My brother heard a god awful scream not too far from there this past elk season; he also heard a large tree crash down without there being any strong winds blowing that would cause that to happen. There are a couple reports on your website that are only a few miles as the crow flys from where we were. I would be willing to talk to someone if they feel that they would like to however, I would like to keep my name and the exact location private if possible. Additional details about the tracks fround in their tire tracks: Scott, As I recall, we really didn't notice anything until after we had already gotten back to the pickup. I was taking a leak a few feet behind the truck when I really paid any attention and noticed what looked like a footprint in the mud; I didn't have a light so I had my friend shine his light on the road as we walked back down a ways. What we first saw wasn't a full complete track so at first we just thought it was a probably nothing more than a bear track. It was only after we went back for a ways that we were able to notice that some of the tracks were in our tire tracks and of the ones we seen we could only identify one of those footprints that showed it completely from heel to the toes; what we also thought was weird was the fact that it looked as if it was spread out it was in a really straight line; what I mean is that where the prints showed in the mud it was like whatever it was that was walking it looked as if it had been walking on a tightrope or something, if that makes any sense. we only went back about 50 yards from the pick up and I would say that we could see about 5 or 6 partial tracks where there was mud that showed something; the one complete track we saw was near a large mud puddle where the ground stayed wet enough for there to be a large mud hole across the whole road; we really couldn't notice anything where the road was made up of grass and gravel. The one complete track we did see was actually the track that had been furthest away from our pick up; when we saw that track we both looked at each other and made some kind of comment as to we didn't really believe what it was was that we were looking at and at that point we both were ready to get the hell out of there. When we were up hunting on the hill and even when we were walking out we never put things together, like the smell we had experienced off and on as we walked out or the tracks as possibly being related until after we started down the hill and went home; like I said before, we thought when we were walking out that the smell was probably just a musty old bear; just like we thought those tracks were until we saw the one furthest away from the truck. I hope that helps you; it's been awhile so if I'm leaving anything out or think about something, I don't think I have but if I did I'll be sure to let you know.

The witness and I talked for an hour about his experience. Since the incident happened so many years ago, and the site is behind a locked gate many miles, going to the site was not necessary. As some background, this witness is Native American. He has lived in and hunted in the area his whole life. He is a reliable expert on the game animals of the area. Two items stand out in his report. First is the persistent smell. He described it as a musky, wet-fur smell. It seemed to go along with them as they walked out of the woods in the dark, and after they reached the old road, it still was present. He got the impression that it followed along, and he reported the feeling of being watched. Second, they found a clear, 16 inch long footprint in the tire tracks of their vehicle. This place was behind a locked gate, so there were no other people there. His hunting buddy had a key to the gate, so they were the only people in the area. The witness mentioned that neither he nor his hunting partner said anything to anyone about the incident for many years. Later, he confided in his brother about what happened. His brother then told him that his hunting partner had also told him (the brother) of the incident, and that despite the long time since it happened that both told the same account exactly and in great detail. Based on the smell, the finding of the footprints in their tire tracks, and that they were the only humans in the area, I conclude that the witness and his friend were followed by a curious sasquatch.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=25907

He also described heavy, bipedal footsteps that he heard from the nearby thickets, and related the palpable sensation of being watched. He also felt a menacing presence which prompted him to immediately leave the area, but not before he discovered a very fresh and very large animal scat lying in the middle of the logging road. He gathered a 6"" piece of the much larger scat, which he described as smelling so strongly that he could barely approach it, much less pick it up. He froze the scat as soon as he got home and gave me the scat for examination. It appears to consist principally of animal fur that is compressed into disc-like sections. It has an intensely foul odor even when frozen. He also found a few reddish-brown hairs, 4"" to 5"" long in a tree which he saved and gave me for analysis. He thought they may be deer or elk.

BFRO,Oregon,Polk,6734,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,2003,July,24,Summer,B,footprint,NA,"I may have stumbled onto a print by pure accident, while hiking with my niece and nephew in the Siuslaw Natl. Forest, west of Dallas, Or. I will give details of the location later, as not to saturate the site with the public, so I can finish my investigation in the area and get more readings and data... GPS, photos, and history on the area… Here is what I have thus far.... On the mid afternoon of 24 July, I took my niece age 13, and nephew age 16, to an area I used to hunt and log about 30 years ago west of Dallas, Oregon. Thirty years has changed the area quite a bit as Weyerhauser has bought up a lot of the land, Boise and Hampton Co. as most of the area is logged out, there is still a large standing area of some old growth and an area in which to hike. We were not 15 min. out from my truck on a trail and my nephew blurted out... ""Uncle Ron, look at this foot print!"" Off the trail a foot or two was a large print made in dried mud, (the last rain in the area was about 6 July 2003), so the print was well defined and clear as the photo shows. Several things I noticed about the print, 1) It was not a boot print as no boot tracks were showing, the print was smooth, consistent with a bare foot print. 2) The width was about 9 inches wide at the largest width, and about 14 inches long. 3) Toe contours could clearly be seen, but it looks like what ever made he print may have stepped on a twig, wood, so not all the toes made an imprint in the mud, as the casting shows. 4) The foot print clearly shows a heel print, and arch in the foot, the edge of the foot at wide proportions from a very heavy individual. 5) As the trail is used lightly by mountain bikers and horses, as seen by tracks on the trail. Our 5 hours up on the trail, I only saw one mountain biker that day while in the area. So, it is not used that much, maybe only by locals who live in Dallas or people who know the area. I attempted to make GPS readings that day, but for some reason, my GPS could not pick up satellite signals possibly from the heavy canopy of trees. Another attempt for a long/lat reading with negative results on a second trip. I will attempt a 3rd trip with new batteries and see what happens. The print was, as I said, left of the trail, going SSW. I searched the area for about 2 hours, hair samples on trees, scat, or other prints in area...negative results...photos of area were taken from different perspective points. At this point, as I dont want to ""contaminate"" the area with undue traffic, I will keep the exact location confidential until I complete my investigation. Now a little history on the area. I have hunted the Falls City and Dallas area since 1970. In 1972, while heading to Falls City, Or. my friend Rick swerved to miss something darting across the road... I was a witness to something large, tall and running on two legs, not four....thinking it may have been a bear, or a crazed hunter dressed in black... we both, as teenagers could not answer what we saw... The stories we had heard is, that the Dallas and Falls City area from old timers, and hunter friends of ours, stories of BIGFOOT circulated during that time... especially after the famous RED BLUFF, Ca. film clip of the famous Roger Patterson... from 1967. As the photo shows I took a casting of the footprint, as mentioned, only one was found thus far. Within the next few days I will attempt to return to the area for further investigation and findings. Will keep you posted... You do have my permission to post this report and photos... At this point, ""undetermined what made the print"" At his point only two other Bigfoot Research Websites have been contacted on this sighting, no response as of yet.

BFRO,Oregon,Polk,7537,NA,2003,December,8,Winter,A,animal,NA,"I was driving from Portland to Lincoln city to retrieve my work bag that I had left in Lincoln City over the weekend. I left Portland at 3 am and had only had coffee and donuts to eat; there were not many other cars on the road at all, none that were going in a westerly direction that were within sight of me and only about 2 cars passed me between Spirit Mountain Casino and the site were I had my sighting. I was driving about 55 mph and had my bright lights on and had just came over a rise in the road shortly after you start down the back side of Murphy Hill summit. As I crested the rise out in the distance I saw what I thought at the time was a deer on the left shoulder of the road about 200 yards out from me. I slowed down to 40 mph or so because I didn't want it to jump in front of me or if there were other deer in the area I might spook them into the road. As I got within 75 yards the object began to move across the road from left to right, that is, when I saw that it was not a deer and I thought it might be a bear which I have seen cross a road before but this was way different. The object was hunched over slightly and was on two legs and cleared the road in about 4 steps. The best way to describe the color was dark brown to black and I would guess the hair to be 4 or 5 inches. The arms looked to come down to mid thigh area. I did not see the face except for there seemed to be a deer-like shine coming from the face area. The height was about 7ft + as it disappeared over the edge of the road to the right. I was about 50 yards away by this time. I was starting to feel pretty weird like this was something I had never seen. Hard to explain the feeling as I passed the spot where it went over the bank I tried to look over and see where it had gone. I was going about 25 mph now as I went about 20 yards past the spot and stopped I then reversed my car to the spot where I had seen it go over the bank. I stopped my car and left the engine running I had my window rolled down slightly for air flow as I was driving. When I stopped I could smell a musty type smell not real bad but strong enough to notice. I could hear some movement in the brush but not a lot because of the car noise and the fact that my window was only down 2 or three inches on the left side when the object was now on my right. I had a really strong feeling that I was being watched; every hair on my body was rigid, I had goose bumps over my whole body I have them now as I write about this, not as bad but the chills. I decided then that it would be a really good time to leave so I drove off as fast as my Metro would go I made it to Lincoln City at 6 am and had about 10 cars pass me going east on hwy 18 in that time.When I got there I went to my girlfriend's to get my bag and was going to come right back to Portland to work. Instead I stayed until 9 am then left to go back to Portland. As I drove by the spot I thought about stopping but decided against it. I know the area well though because I helped a lady who had rolled her car off the road in the same are many years ago. The bank in the are is about 7 ft down on both sides and is swampy in some places. I lived in Lincoln City for many years and have spent time in the woods alone and with others and have never felt or seen anything like this I don’t know what to make of it except for it being Bigfoot. No bear walks on its back legs like this.

BFRO,Oregon,Tillamook,691,NA,1979,NA,NA,Summer,B,activity,NA,"I already submitted a report of this incident but thought I'd provide a more detailed account of what happened after reading some of those submitted by others. And after searching my memory of 20 years ago a bit more thoroughly. Just after sunrise my wife and I were laying in our tent talking. The tent was situated in a clearing next to the Wilson River right along the edge of the tree line. We were the only people camping in this clearing and it was very remote from other camping areas, which is why we chose it. Off in the distance at an angle behind the tent and deep in the forest we heard what sounded like someone breaking large sticks or small logs against the trunk of a tree. We thought this odd due to there not being any trails or roads where we heard this. Why would anyone be out there? Also we were the only ones around to the best of our knowledge as this was not close to any campgrounds. The early hour also added to the strangeness of the sounds we heard. After maybe a couple of minutes of hearing this, the sounds became more intense and changed to what sounded more like very large branches being snapped and small trees actually being uprooted and pushed over. The sounds slowly moved towards us at this point. I thought there must be someone driving some kind of machinery through the forest and plowing over anything standing in the way. Perhaps a Cat being used to forge new access for a logging operation. As it got to within maybe 150 feet of our tent I realized there was no engine sound. It kept coming closer. When it got to within what sounded like 50 feet or so, the sound of trees being uprooted and broken stopped and was replaced with the sound of very heavy and slow footsteps still coming closer to the tent. The sound continued approaching until it was within maybe 3 or 4 feet behind the tent then it stopped as if examining our tent or just waiting. Unfortunately the tent had no windows to look out so we just laid there being as silent as possible while I clutched my hatchet and held my breath. I can't be positive because we were both very frightened by this point but I thought I could hear what sounded like something huge breathing just a couple of feet off the back of our tent. This may have been my imagination though. We were both petrified. My wife said she didn't hear breathing. After a pause of 15 to 20 seconds the footsteps began to angle off into the forest again. When the footsteps seemed to be 15 or 20 feet away, I quietly got up and crawled out of the tent to see what had made this racket. I walked around the back of the tent still clutching my hatchet and peered into the forest. It was too dense to see very far so I started to venture into the woods towards the direction of the footsteps which I could still hear fading off in the distance. I followed for 20 or 30 feet and could see nothing. That's when the fear got the best of me and I scrambled back to the tent.We remained in the tent for at least another hour before venturing out. I kept peering into the forest but didn't see or hear anything again. By now, friends who we were expecting began to show up so we felt a bit safer. When my curiosity finally got the best of me, I ventured into the forest towards the direction of the crashing and snapping sounds we had heard coming towards us. No one would come with me. After going for 50 or more feet in that direction, I came upon a huge tangle of fallen old growth logs with a very dense stand of smaller trees and dense underbrush on the other side where the sound had originated. Several smaller trees had been snapped off or pushed over. No machine could ever have crossed over the fallen logs, as they were several feet in diameter.And I know of no machine that makes footsteps. Then fear took hold again and I ran to the safety of the clearing without looking for footprints. I never went back into the forest the entire weekend after that. We could only explain what we heard as being a sasquatch. The only problem I had with this theory was that I has always thought if these creatures existed they would be very silent and reclusive avoiding humans whenever possible. Certainly not crashing through the forest like a bulldozer. These sounds were intentional. I can't say for certain what we heard, but I do know without any doubt that it was not a human, machinery, a bear, an elk, or anything else that might be commonly found in these forests. I've spent much of the last 20 years trying to come up with an explanation for what we heard. I have none other than a sasquatch.

BFRO,Oregon,Tillamook,13653,Caroline Curtis,1995,August,14,Summer,A,animal,NA,"Back several years ago, I reported this sighting to Peter Byrne, who took it very seriously. I agreed to talk on camera, to ""Good Morning America"" back in 1996. My conditions were that only my voice would be used, and not my name. They interviewed me, but then showed me completely. I felt betrayed by ""Good Morning America"". I and my girlfriend were both in law enforcement at the time. I was, at the time, a US Forest Service Officer (Law Enforcement LVII) and later a police officer. Now I have been out of the field for 3 years, and I want to tell my story and show the photos. On August 14, 1995, my girlfriend and I were camped on a beach in Oregon, north of Lincoln City and south of Tillamook. We were on vacation, and we were the only people on that beach. We had a good fire going and dusk was approaching around 21:00 Hours. We were camped on a bluff about 7 ft above the surf and had a clear view of the beach north and south. We were set back on the bluff around 100 ft from the shoreline. I noticed a figure which I thought was a person, standing south of us on the beach, I guess around 100 yards from our location, standing near the shoreline, looking in our direction. At that distance I thought it was strange the person was covered in black clothing, so we thought. I was a bit alarmed thinking someone may be planning to harm us. We also thought it was strange because nothing was down the beach except rugged beachline, to at least Lincoln City, 20 Miles to the south. When I lost sight of it I was a bit uneasy, wondering what the person was up to. Later, we saw the person come back, but not stop. It kept walking in our direction, to a distance of about 50 yards. It stopped, turned around, and headed back to the south. Again, 5 minutes later, the person came back, this time it kept walking to a 90 degree angle to our location, and turned around and headed back south. By now the sun had set but the moon was full or close to it. It was a very bright twilight, with the sand and ocean. The ""person"" in question again came back, following closer to the shoreline this time. It walked directly by us and past to the north now. We noticed the person was very large and seemed to be as tall as we were on the bluff. It was jet black and had the forward posture with the long swinging arms. We also noticed the person almost seemed totally uninterested in our presence and looked like it was looking for something on the beach, stopping occasionally and starting up again. The person turned around and went directly back at a quicker pace and headed at a fast walking speed (guessing 4-6 mph) to the south. We were amazed at how unusual the scene was. The pace, the fact the motion was more fluid, and not bouncing as we walk or jog. Also, all black. There was no other color, from head to toe. The head was pointy. The ""person"" now headed south quickly, and went out of sight. I grabbed my mag-light and ran down to where my girlfriend told me to stop, so I knew where to look for prints. Just before that point I nearly tripped on a track, and was amazed at how deep it was. It was at least 10 inches down. I pressed down maybe a inch or two at most in the sand as I walked. I yelled for my girlfriend to come down to see what I was looking at. She reluctantly came down. When she got close she immediately said, ""Oh my God!"" The tracks where at least 16"" long and 10 inches wide. As we were focusing on the tracks, my mag-light went out. I told her not to worry. I had a spare bulb in the back of the flashlight. As I was fumbling to change the bulb, in bright moonlight, she yelled, ""It's coming back!"" I dropped the bulb in the sand and I just stared as it approached us at a fast rate. From the south, at 100 yards, at a fast clip. She pulled my arm and tried to drag me back up to camp. I told her I was staying and wanted to find out what it was. She became frantic, screaming, ""come on!!"" as she headed to camp. I stood there and I was stunned. At a far distance of 80 yards or so, this thing was taller then me, at a level field. As it got closer I started yelling ""You better stop! I am going to shoot!"" I was unarmed. It kept coming, directly at me, like I didn't exist. Its shoulders seemed to be at least 4-5 ft wide, with no neck. I started to notice hair all over, and started to make out the face. At that point I realized, and I said out loud, ""Oh My God, it's not a human!"" I couldn't move for a moment. When I got control again I ran like hell, toward my girlfriend, who was screaming, ""Run!"" I ran fast, thinking it was coming for me. I got to the top, and was happy to see it kept walking past where I had been standing. It walked beyond where I was standing, then turned around and walked back to the south, out of sight. We then ran over the hill to the rental car. I yelled at her, ""Where are the keys??"". We realized they where back down on the beach in the tent, in my bag. We hesitated and then went back. We grabbed them and were going to leave everything else. After a few moments we calmed down and decided to go back to our things. Then we decided to stay through the night, after my girlfriend started saying that it didn't hurt us and it could have. We decided to stay, and I got the video camera out of the car. I kept the fire going all night, staying up. She didn't make it all night, and fell asleep. I didn't see it again. As soon as day break came, I took the film camera and took pictures of the footprints, heading both north and south on the beach. Luckily they where not very degraded due to the wind. I followed the tracks and used items and myself to give depth and distance. I noticed the tracks all went to the east at a point. This was the direction I assumed the creature went. After I took several photos of the tracks I ran back to camp. We left Oregon, drove to Seattle and caught our flight back to Colorado. After a few weeks, I did a bit of research and contacted Richard Greenwell [deceased], of the International Society of Cryptozoology. He interviewed me and had me get in contact with Peter Byrne in Portland. Byrne contacted me and wanted me to come back out and show him the location of the sighting and the trail. I couldn't get back out due to vacation time availability. He found the location and looked around, but nothing was found. Later that next year, Byrne gave me a call and said ""Good Morning America"" wanted to do a story on my sighting. I told him I could not, due to my employment position. He assured me that I would be off-camera, and they would only use a voice-over. I agreed to do the interview. My girlfriend, who was a deputy sheriff, decided to stay far away from the media, in case things got out on identity. I reluctantly agreed to do the interview. I did this also to help Peter Byrne, so he could possibly get some funding for his organization, knowing it would help his cause. Later the tape was aired, showing me on camera and speaking. Not good! … Since that time, in 1996, I have been back to this area a few times to look around, but have not contacted anyone else about it.

Well anyway, I got up about 6am, got out my 22 and started out on a hike. Before leaving, I heard a friend say ""wait up and I'll will go with you"" I said ""fine but no talking I want to check out the game in the area before they check us out"". About 5 minutes up the road I noticed about half way up a hill was a large rock outcropping with a black stump about 9 feet tall. It was around 400 yards from us. I ask my friend ""do you see that weird shiny stump on those rocks up there?"" He said yes. Then I said ""look at it through your scope"". Then the gun went off. He said he didn't mean to fire and that he couldn't find that stump any more. In disbelief I looked and didn't see it any more. When looking in the only areas something could go, I saw it walking very fast, long arms swinging, one basic black color. I said ""Sh*#$@& you shot at that person!"" or what ever it was. We ran back to camp and didn't say much because we did not want to get in trouble. Later I showed a friend who camps there all the time the place and he said no one could climb up there early enough to be up there by 6 am. I agreed. He also pointed out that there were no other camper around this area. It is in the Cook Canyon area, very steep rocky country, great for elk hunting. I am convinced that this was a bigfoot.

BFRO,Oregon,Tillamook,690,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1998,August,2,Summer,A,animal,NA,"My name is Kurt, me and my fiance Shawn were camping up off of Ben Smith Road August 1-2,1998. Sunday the 2nd, we packed up camp by noon and headed down to the Wilson River to cool off a bit. It was very hot. We drove down off of Ben Smith road going east on the flats road that follows the river. We crossed the river to lay in the sun. We were there for 10-15 minutes, when I saw someone or something down river about 45-50 yards swaying back & forth with its head down the whole time, while also moving up & down river with no problem at all. I didn't think much of it at first, but when Shawn my got up and moved to the middle of the river it spotted us--froze and then glared at us. Then I moved to the middle and didn't take my eyes off of it. It moved to the right of the river in some bushes somewhat hiding it seemed like. Then I knew something wasn't right, it had big hair & long arms. It didn't act human-like at all. I couldn't make out a face just eye sockets. I wondered what it was wearing winter clothes for when it was 90 degrees outside. They were not clothes. It had reddish-blonde like hair and was about 6ft tall. I have hunted and fished up at Lee's camp for years and have never seen anything like it before. After we got home that night we talked about it more, leaving us with a strange feeling.

At the risk of repetition of the original report, I will flesh it out here from their respective reports. The main highway #6 from Portland to Tillamook follows the Wilson River for some distance. A side road loops back on its other side and has a number of turnouts, evidently sparsely used by fishermen and hunters. The couple, Kurt V. and Shawn J., he 40, she presumably younger, first had lunch next to the river on the car side and then crossed over in bathing suits. On the other side they found a spot in the sun on a sand bank, the river in front of them making some noise between the projecting rocks (not a lot of flow). The main highway was now behind them on their side by perhaps 300-400 feet and slightly higher, not visible through the forest but clearly audible. Downstream from them was a minor barrier of trees (alders) lying across the river and behind these the river expanded to a wide, flat, pondlike area, about 300 feet long, with overhanging trees on both sides, before it resumed its rocky faster course. At the lower end of this flat area is a house set well back from the river, from which, during my visit, two small and trusting girls with a dog came to the river to feed ducks and go to a beaver house. As they lay there, Kurt and Shawn noticed a ""person"" who came out of the edge of the dense forest (second growth alder and Douglas fir, with old growth stumps with springboard notches) and waded into this still area. Very soon they revised their opinion that the ""person"" must be weird, since he wore a fur coat in the 90 degree heat. Kurt by this time suspected it to be a sasquatch, but didn't mention it to Shawn to avoid upsetting her. They watched the ""weird person"" walking up and down in the middle of the still river area, at a distance of between 150 feet minimum and 300 feet maximum from them, always looking into the water but not catching anything. The creature was only to its calves in the water and had peculiarly long arms, a very short neck, no crest that was noted, about 6-6.5 feet tall, walking very surefootedly on the slippery large river cobbles, crossing which the couple ""almost killed themselves"". After about 30 minutes of this observation, Shawn decided to go into the water. At this moment the sasquatch detected them for the first time despite the fact that they had brightly colored swim suits on and had talked in conversational tones the entire time (so much for the sasquatch's superhuman sensory acuity). The sasquatch ""froze"" in the water and stood upright, just behind the barrier to face them and look at them. Shawn stood for a while, then sat down, and Kurt also went to the water's edge and sat down on a rock. They now gazed at each other with minimal apprehension on the human side for about 15 minutes. They noticed that its thick hair was ""really wild"", though showing some gloss, of dark brown color with red glints (the head evidently a bit lighter). They said if it had been human at that distance they could have recognized the person's face, but the sasquatch face was so dark that all they were impressed by was the deeply recessed eye area, meaning presumably brow ridges. Eventually the sasquatch sidled over to their side of the river and climbed behind a bush, where it evidently thought itself concealed, but it bent over sideways to keep looking at the couple, who could see its head and upper body. By this time they were both reasonably convinced of its non-human nature and got somewhat more apprehensive, returned across the river to their car and left. Shawn declined to stop the few hundred feet downstream to look at the site from a different angle. They concluded on their own, without hardly any prior knowledge, that they had been dealing with a juvenile, no sexual characteristics visible, and the head seemingly rather rounded. They estimate that their total encounter lasted close to an hour, which at such relatively close quarters must be a near record. But I think the sasquatch was juvenile and inexperienced and wanted to get an eyeful of those near naked dwarves. The area is overrun by elk prints and very steep elk game trails. The adjacent mountainside is steep enough to require some use of hands on a game trail in addition to having an understory of waist to chest-high ferns, brambles and salal. Trying to go up these slopes is hard and highly unpromising. The sasquatch evidently descended these slopes. While at their camp earlier in the morning, they had heard 5 hoots, almost like an owl, though Kurt commented at the time that it was a weird time for an owl to hoot. Both they and I looked for footprints, but the area is not conducive to capturing any and it had been bone dry for weeks. The area is not far from other sighting and footprint records. We went back to the site with Kurt and a crew from Focus TV (Munich, Germany) in conjunction with a more general interview. Subsequently we drove up higher to a loading deck the had a good overview of the Coast Range. The German interviewer was visibly impressed by the fact that adjacent deep, V-shaped canyons had no signs of roads, Autobahnen, cows, inns, restaurants, barns or any sign of human activity but were seemingly inaccessible due to their extremely steep sides and dense vegetation.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=690

I always keep an eye on the sides of the raods for traks to see where an animal may have crossed. Well about a half a mile up I saw a track, with very decerable toes (5) and I put my foot up nxt to the print, I am a size 12 and the print was about the same The funny thing was, the print looked like the foot was broken and healed wrong, I do know that it was not human and it deffinatly was not any type of animal I hunt for. My fiance also saw this print as well. As we first hit the trail, I should mention we both herd a howl the likes of nothing I have never heard before in my LIFE, the hair on the back of my neck stood on end, even my fiance said that it was the wierdest thing she ever heard. There was no noticable odor in the air at that time. This was all in the morning at about 6:10am. I will be checking this area again in about a week.

BFRO,Oregon,Tillamook,36280,Cindy & Jerod Caddell,2012,August,12,Summer,B,wood knock,vocalization,"My adult daughters where out camping the weekend of 10AUG2012 in a slightly remote camp in the Tillamook forest. For 2 nights in a row they heard possible big foot calls that went on for 20min the first night and about 3 min the next night. I can assure you it was not any Elk, Deer, any of the owl species, That calls where whoop call, and im told extremely loud, This group totaled 6 that weekend that heard this series of calls. The following weekend this weekend friday 18AUG I myself and a friend from work and his daughter went to the very same camp to hear for ourselves and attempt to get recordings of the calls, long story short, I’m an experienced out doors man as an avid Bow hunter and fisherman I’ve spent countless hrs in the woods and have heard most of all the local animal calls. From all the known owl calls, to every possible combination of elk and deer calls to the death moan of a bear. I’ve been known to follow elk heads at night and just be in a good place to hunt them in the Am. Be that as it may On Friday the 18th I set out to this camp and waited for the arrival of my work friend and his daughter. After dinner we relaxed at the camp fire till about 9:00 p.m. and set out for a short hike to the power line rd and did some Knocking, with no responses’ we returned to camp and was doing a little star gazing around the camp fire. At 10:15 p.m. to our astonishment we heard in rapid succession a series of Knocks 1,2,3,4,5 pause then 1,2,3,4,5, coming from the SE 2 sets of about 5 of 6 knocks with a delay between sets of about no more than 5 seconds. Within 10 seconds of the second set of knocks we had our recorder going hoping to capture more knocks on tape when from the NE we heard a classic call back Howl in response 2 Howl calls in fact, We have captured those calls on tape. Being that our camp was in-between the calls my best estimate of distance or camp was from the calls where no more than a ¼ to a ½ of a mile as the crow fly’s with us between them, our camp that night was the only camp site taken in the whole camp ground. With the closest set of camp grounds approximately 6 miles away. In conclusion with my current back ground in Metrology and reporting my findings with an unbiased opinion using the return calls taped on your show that I’ve heard over time and applying them as a reference standard I must therefore conclude this as the genuine article and report this as very plausible given my own personal experience. All I need now is to personally see one and it push it over the top for me. As it stands right now I feel 85% certain that this phenomenon is real. I am no expert with regards to Bigfoot and would love to hear your thoughts on this matter and would very much enjoy putting you in contact with all involved and giving you the audio we recorded. I look forward to hearing back from you as I would very much like your thoughts on the recordings we have.",NA,Banks,Oregon Hwy 6 W,Tillamook State Forest,NA,NA,,NA,2130,warm,clear,waning crescent,25,"forest , ridges",NA,NA,NA,NA,804.67,2640.0,880,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,whoop,yes,2 set of 5-6 knocks then pause for 5s,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,"Fellow investigator Cindy Caddell and I, Jerod Caddell, responded to corresponding reports submitted by witnesses Larry on 8/19/2012 and Marc on 8/21/2012 regarding howls that were recorded on 8/17/2012 in the Tillamook State Forest of Oregon. Cindy conducted an initial telephone interview with Larry and he emailed us the recorded howls, which were compelling. Larry and Marc agreed to meet Cindy and I where they recorded the howl vocalizations so we could investigate the area. On 9/02/2012 Cindy and I met both witnesses at the location in the Tillamook State Forest. The area was quiet, and for the most part secluded. It was also geographically located in a “bowl” surrounded by gravel roads and thick forests. We walked with them around the campground and noted the healthy forest, dense undergrowth, plentiful water sources and numerous edible plants and berries in the area. There were also numerous game trails and several signs of elk and deer. Bear scat was located on one of the trails. Larry stated that he is an avid bow hunter with years of experience in the Oregon wilderness. He can track animals and easily differentiate between sounds made by indigenous animals. Marc stated he was an avid outdoorsman with a wealth of climbing and backpacking experience. Both witnesses appeared to be credible and what they recorded sounded like genuine evidence. Larry explained that his daughter had been camping with friends at the location the weekend before the howls were recorded and told him that she heard howls on two successive nights. The first night she (and a group of six others) heard calls that lasted for 20 minutes and the second night she heard calls that lasted for three minutes. Both witnesses, along with Marc's daughter, went to the same camp the following weekend (8/17-19) and began conducting their own investigation hoping to record what Larry's daughter had heard. While at the camp, there were no other campers in the campground and the next closest campground was miles away. At around 2100 hours, Larry, Marc, and Marc's daughter walked the roads around the campground. One of the roads was bordered with power lines and they did a series of knocks on one of the wooden poles at the top of a ridge surrounding their camp. There was initially no response to the knocks. At approximately 2215 hours, after arriving back at their camp, they suddenly heard a series of wood knocks in rapid succession that sounded close. Marc quickly turned on his camera, which has a video/audio feature, hoping to record the wood knocks. It was at this time when two howls came from the northeast that seemed to be in response to the wood knocking they just heard and Marc's camera recorded them. Larry and Marc said the howls were close to camp and they were able to feel reverberation through their bodies from the force of the howls. Larry stated that he was positive the howls were not from any animal he has ever heard in the wild before. * Marc & Larry's Audio Recording * On 09/29/2012, Cindy and I conducted our own investigation of the area, along with the witnesses, and set up our camp near the original location. There were no other campers in the campground and any activity on the roads or trails in the area would be heard in the camp from a long distance away. The thick woods and undergrowth surrounding the camp would make it difficult for anyone to sneak in without being heard. After taking an initial walk around the campground, we set up two digital recorders on the outskirts of the camp about 50 yards away. The night was clear and cold, approximately 40 degrees, and there were no signs of other people in the area. The digital recorders were activated at approximately 2030 hours. At 2142 hours, Cindy did a series of “whoop” calls. About one and a half minutes later, there were several higher pitched howls from a distance of a quarter to a half mile from camp. Those calls were answered by a series of deeper pitched howls from the top of a ridge further away. The howls seemed to be a form of communication and they went back and forth for approximately two minutes. The howls were recorded on two separate digital recorders and were also clearly heard by all of us in the camp. * Investigators' Audio Recording * There was no other activity noticed by anyone for the remainder of the night, but the recorded audio from that night revealed branches being broken, wood knocks, and the sound of tapping. These sounds started 30 minutes after we heard the howl calls and continued sporadically for several hours. Cindy sent the audio recordings to an experienced audio technician who works with BFRO investigators. The technician cleaned up the recordings and thinks the sound of breaking branches was made by large branches being snapped and thinks that the tapping sound was the sound of rocks being tapped together. Summary: The witness' claims were validated by us having the same type of experience in the same area and being able to capture audio evidence in our own recording. The howls we heard and recorded did not sound like any of the common animals found in the area and were similar to suspected sasquatch vocalizations documented in other regions.",NA,NA,audio is compelling,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=36280

The area is approx 1700 ft in elevation along a steep ridge and within 2 miles as the crow flies from a popular county park along a major river. We accessed the location via a somewhat abandoned logging road, and there was evidence of elk and deer scouting activity. The location of the subject was approximately 300 yards to the creek bed below. In the topography between the subject location and the observation site, there was second and third growth Doug Fir and scrub brush. Across the valley, there were several clear-cuts in the distance. According to the witness, using only their naked eye the subject appeared to be sitting and/or standing adjacent to a large log laying on the ground. The log was still there at the time of my investigation. With binoculars I noticed that there was a road adjacent to the clearing where the subject was observed, and on that road there appeared to be a locked gate. After inspection of an updated forest service road map, I determined that the gate was across the same road we were on, only off into the valley below. For transcription purposes, I video-recorded the witness description of the encounter. We departed the area and I prepped the gear I had packed for spending the night on the ridge alone. When I returned to the site it was dusk and a heavy fog started to roll in. I mounted a thermal-imaging video camera on the roof-rack of my vehicle, which was inputting to a DVR on the floorboard in the passenger compartment. I also mounted a stereo digital audio recorder with 24"" parabolic microphone on a tripod and focused the parabola on the 120 degrees to the rear of my camp. At about midnight, I began recording with both devices. On the ridge, I was surprised to learn that I had a good strong signal with my cell phone, so decided to call an investigator friend of mine, who had asked me to call if I had reception. After about 30 minutes, I finished the call, and began hearing some light tapping noises, down the ridge toward the witness-site of the subject, and to my right and left. I began talking in a normal tone of voice in response to the tapping. The tapping appeared to be in response to my talking. I continued this for about one hour, and at one point after there was a very loud wood knock apparently from the valley below close to the original witness encounter site. The tapping sounds eventually stopped. After another hour or so, I got into my sleeping bag in my tent and slept soundly through the night. When I awoke, the fog was heavy and I broke camp and made my way back to town for breakfast. Upon review of the audio and video, I found both of the ""conversations"" I had (with the friend on the phone, and with the tapping sounds) to be intact in the audio. In the video there was one heat signature likely attributable to a large rodent, opossum, or raccoon close to the ground from behind my tent. Along this area was a steep drop-off and a game trail. There were no cast-able impressions in the substrate, which was mostly forest-floor duff. Several days later, I returned to the area to do a daylight investigation of the location in the valley where the subject was spotted sitting on a log. The log measured 35"" in diameter, apparently an old-growth cedar that for some reason was left behind from logging operations that took place most likely decades ago. With that measurement and review of the witnesses' account, I estimate the subject to be approximately 7 feet in height. I have cataloged both audio and video footage for further study and analysis, nothing clear or significant enough to include with this report. My evidence collected from the site that night along with the eye-witness account, combined to create a compelling case for the existence of bigfoot(s) in this area and a very high likelihood that the subject the witness spotted sitting on the log was a bigfoot. I will continue to study this location and update this report.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=41704

The hair stood up on the back of my neck. About 5 minutes later another yell comes about a quarter mile north of me only this time its 3 times louder. It yelled 5 separate times with about 10 seconds between each 10 second long yell. These yells were much stronger of a voice than the first two yells. About 2 minutes later the first yeller did it again only it sounded like it was further south. I don't believe a human could be as loud as this was at a distance and the voice was far too big.

Received from witness Brian Hornaday on December 22, 2019. ""A friend and I were regulars to Jones creek campground area. We went up on a weekday planning on staying a couple nights. There is a 3 way fork about 1/4 mile from the day use bridge spot If you go straight and go about 3 or 4 miles there is a little bridge, and to the left a Cul De sac type camping area where there are 3 big camping spaces spread out and one in the middle. There was a stream that went along one side, but it was about a hundred feet from the sites. On the other side of the stream there is a steep wooded hill up until you get to the highway, with no place for people to just be hanging out. Its all thick brush and trees so anything on the other side of the river, is certainly going to be an animal. On top of that, there was no one camping there at all for miles since it was a weeknight and way out of the way. It had to be sometime between 12am and 2am when we finally both went in our separate tents and fall asleep. We were both almost asleep, then suddenly we heard this crazy yelling scream coming from the other side of the stream. it would last for about 10 seconds and then stop. And had to have screamed over 10 times. The noise is really hard to describe though. A screeching/bumbling/rattling with both high pitch and lower interchanged. When I try to tell the story, people mention a cougar. From what I've heard they weren't the same. This was far more bizarre.. I could maybe imagine a human attempting to make the sound, but the loudness and the length of the scream was unnatural. We both jumped in our cars and rolled down the windows. We could hear it get to the stream and possibly on the trail that leads to our campsite from the stream. We didn't hear the movements, Just the scream. I decided to blare on my horn and my friend popped his trunk and pulled out his shotgun. He fired off a shot into the sky and the scream stopped. We slept in our cars and the next day we walked down the trail to the stream. We immediately realized how close it was to us and the effort it went though to try to scare us. As well as the balls they must have had in order to just walk up to a campsite screaming from the woods. We packed up the site and decided not to camp another night. It took us a year to go back to Jones Creek. We now go right at the 3 way stop and stay at the diamond mill staging area instead. We also did go and stay another night at the scream spot with another buddy of ours. Nothing happened.

BFRO,Oregon,Umatilla,7124,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1976,June,30,Summer,A,animal,NA,"I was attending a senior Boy Scout leadership camp, Brownsea II, in NE Oregon in midsummer 1976. The only reason I recall the details of the date was because my birthday fell on the Sunday after camp broke up. The details of the location are fuzzy, the incident is not. I recall three inexplicable incidents from that week (27.June - 3.July). First, I recall waking up early in the week about 0600. Even in late June in the Blue Mountains, mornings are brisk, and no one was very quick to leave their tents. One of my campmates announced his intention to relieve himself about the same time I was crawling out of the tent. At that moment, I heard a great deal of brush movement in the hillside brush overlooking our camp. Unfortunately, I can't recall whether I heard footfalls or not. Knowing now that even deer are far from quiet when running through underbrush, I can't rule out the possibility of deer grazing immediately above our tents and becoming spooked as we exited our tents. But it WAS extremely noisy. Third (second is the most significant), the camp was breaking up Saturday morning and we were fixing lunch for our parents who were supposed to be arriving shortly. One of the camp leaders was showing off some footprints he claimed to have found by the river that morning and cast, then obliterated them to prevent distractions. I don't recall the particulars, but they were larger than average, proportionately correct as near as I can recall. I've always looked on the story behind those casts with both skepticism and intrigue. Most significant was a midweek event, I believe Wednesday night. The exercises was to follow a set of instructions using a compass to find a location, set up camp for the night, then return the next morning. Following our instructions, we made our way along a trail beside the creek up the wooded ravine. If memory serves me, we left somewhere around 1830, and walked some 1000 paces up the ravine ... roughly between a half and three-quarter mile distance. We were greeted by a camp staff who had placed himself unobtrusively off to the side to make sure we arrived safely, then headed back down the trail. The trail was not overly steep, but on the opposite side of the creek, the hill came right down to the creek and was reasonably thick with trees and vegetation. I no longer recall, but I believe I wouldn't be incorrect if I said we arrived between 1900 and 1930. Because of the ravine setting and the tall trees around us, darkness settled in quickly. I seem to recall the sun setting more or less on our left as we hiked up the trail After taking a few minutes to set up camp and start evening preparations, I, being a fisherman, decided to dip into my emergency gear and try my hand in the creek immediately downstream from the camp. It was probably about 1945 at this point ... still light, but darkness was closing in and fine details are harder to see. Using a small safety pin with a worm (I'm usually a fly fisherman), some monofilament and a piece of wood, I made a crude rig to test a couple of holes. One of the scouts watched me for five, maybe 10 minutes before returning to the camp between 30 and 50 yards away. Shortly after he left me, I had the distinctly uncomfortable feeling of being watched. Many times since then, I have been in the woods alone, frequently fishing, and have felt similar sensations, only to find deer hoof prints in the streamside mud filling with water, but this sensation was ... unique, as it made the hair on my neck stand up. The creek was not very wide, and I was standing more or less in the middle of it, straddling the stream with each foot on a rock and facing upstream, with the trail to my left (more or less west) and the wooded hillside on my immediate right. I recall very little standing room on my right. I hesitated for a moment or two, then turned around to my right. I have no explanation or recollection why I turned in that direction. Because this was a small ravine which was thorougly wooded on both sides, light was fading, but there was sufficient light to see by. Maybe 35 yards downstream, I didn't see much ... only what I can describe as a long leg and foot disappearing up the hillside into the trees and brush. It was much darker than the foliage, moving and so it stood out. As the leg disappeared from view, I vividly recall turning around shaking my head--a habit I still have--perhaps in disbelief at what I saw ... kind of like, tree stumps don't usually get up and move like that. Recently, while watching a nature program, I saw a similar angle of a bear disappearing into the brush in a similar direction. The bear's legs being shorter, the knees bent much closer to the ground and not much above the foot; what I saw was a foot bending at the ankle, but no bend above that. Also, the leg was lifted, unlike a bear's which is, at best, shuffled forward. Best estimates: I saw perhaps 2', 2.5' of leg, but no knee. Finally, I don't recall any odor or unusual silence at the time. One other lighter note: I learned later that night that eyelashes on the nylon inner lining of a down mummy bag sound a lot like cruching leaves but without the footfalls! Needless to say, it took a while to fall asleep that night.

Fahrenbach,1985,December,NA,Winter,A,animal,NA,"I just found your site and do not remember all the details of my sighting but here is the best I can remember of the night I saw something on Cabbage Hill in Oregon; It was December of 1985, right around Christmas. I was driving a truck and trailer going back to Texas from Portland, OR. My co-driver was asleep when I saw it cross the highway (I-84) on top of Cabbage Hill at about 1:30 a.m. I came around a small curve and it looked as surprised as I was. I stopped with it in my headlights and it stopped right in front of me as I almost hit it (about 2 feet from it) and sat and watched it stare at me through the windshield. I was driving a 1984 Peterbilt, long-nosed tractor, which as I recall the top of the hood is about 6 1/2 ft from the ground to the top. This creature was head and shoulders above the top of the hood as it looked at me look back. It was blondish-brown in color, had bright yellowish-red eyes and was not as mean looking as some have told in the TV shows that try to scare you about it. It had some hair but was not as hairy as a bear. I thought at first, it might be a bear that has been losing its hair. It had very human-like features, like a nose that seemed to me as large but human-like. It's mouth was formed like a human's but its teeth were a bit longer but not like fangs. It's belly button was long and deep, it had an inny. It walked like an old man with a back ache, kind of bent slightly forward and stiff. Its arms were longer than a man's but it didn't look like a gorilla with arms too long for its body. I remember thinking to myself that this must be some sort of mutant bear or something. It seemed mad that I was invading its space, it straightened upright and slapped the top of the hood right above the radiator with open hands like it was warning me to leave it alone. I woke my co-driver but he only saw it as it ran into the woods away from the highway where I sat wishing I had a camera to take a picture to show everyone this thing I had seen. I often looked for it the next few years as I drove through this area but never again saw it or anything like it.

The driver had to stop rather sharply, but it was not an emergency stop. He estimates the height of the sasquatch to have been about 8' with a shoulder width of about 4'. The overall appearance of the sasquatch was the equivalent, by the witness' description, of a beautifully shaped, athletic human male with a slender waist. He mentioned futher that it had a dense matted beard, heavy sideburns and coarse, matted bangs, overall a rather hairy face, all of it looking like unkempt human hair. It had pronounced brow ridges, larger than human eyes that were light colored but not reflective in the headlights of the truck, a human type nose, though broad (""bulbous""), with down-facing nostrils, the mouth slightly open, showing large teeth and conspicuous canines though not long enough to be called ""fangs"".

This is a good hour and 1/2 up into the Blues on a some what graveld Rd. I belive it in July or August. It was dusk, I had my head lights on as a came around a bend in the road. Thats when I saw them crossing the road. One was aprox 8 ft the other 7 ft tall. They looked right at me, the head lights reflected thier eyes to be a yellow color, and the sun was out just enough to shine on thier bodies to let me know these were not bear or elk. I came to a stop as they crossed, I got out to see if I could get anothe look as they walked of into the woods but could not see anything, nor did I smell anything odd. I looked for trackes but the ground was hard so I got back in the bug and drove home. A week or 2 latter I was shopping at the eastgate mall and ran into a display of bigfoot set up by acouple of guys by the names of Paul freeman & Wes Summerlin.

There are no lights around the house and no moon, so it was pretty dark out there. So my friend turned his headlights on so I could see my way to the front door.

My 12 year old daughter and I were sitting in the brush waiting for the rest of the party to push the elk to us.

My daughter and I had been hearing what sounded like a branch thumping against the trees from down below us, but steadily approaching our hiding spot. I thought nothing of the sound because one of the party was carrying antlers to ""rattle"" the elk. Eventually, the two of us began to hear distinct rustling noises near us with a grunting and growling sound. The stench was unbelievable. It smelled like a combination of wet mop and wet dog hair that had moldered for awhile. I have been around a bear carcass and it did not smell like this. I was, quite frankly, spooked!

It also began to snow. The roadway was snow-covered and slick. Traffic was moving quite slowly (20-30 mph). Trucks were moving especially slow due to the steep roadway, poor visibility, and slick roads. Traffic was backing up. There were 5-6 vehicles, including mine, travelling as a group, with 2-3 in the left lane and 2-3 in the right. The westbound lanes make a sharp turn to the right, straighten, steepen their grade, go through a cut in the hillside, and make a turn to the left, crossing Patawa Creek. This was in the vicinity of milemarker 222. There is a guardrail alongside the exposed side of the westbound lanes when they are not protected by embankments. As we were driving on the straight section between the curves, I could see the brake lights of the vehicles in front of me come on - the red glow getting brighter. I assumed we were either getting closer to the left turn and people were slowing, or there was some slower moving trucks ahead. I was in the left lane, and slowing down, putting more space between me and the car in front. Suddenly, I saw a large creature sitting/leaning on the pavement side of the guardrail - this would be to my left. It appeared to be watching/waiting for traffic go by. It's head turned from side to side, but I didn't notice detail. I looked at it as I drove by, and noticed that it appeared to be covered by long hair, or a long fur-like coat, which was covered/streaked with snow. It watched me drive by. At first I thought there must be an accident or stalled vehicle ahead (there were none behind me that I had passed), because why would someone be standing/sitting in that location, watching traffic? I was puzzled by what I saw, and noticed there were no vehicles stalled/parked below the location, either. The more I thought about it, the more I realized this was crazy. Why would someone be there? Except for the interstate, this spot is fairly isolated; farms/ranches are quite a long distance away. The terrain is very steep and rugged. The weather was quite cold, damp, inhospitable. If this was a ""person"" stranded or seeking help, he/she/it did nothing to atract attention or to get someone to stop. This was definitely not the time or place one would encounter someone out for a leisurely ""stretch of the legs"". I don't disbelieve in Sasquatch. I know there will always be hoaxes, and logical explanations for things that seem unexplainable. But I also know there are things yet to be ""discovered"", and new discoveries are made regularly. The more I thought about this, the more I began to think that maybe I did see what my second reaction said I saw. I called my wife on my cell to tell her. She got a big kick/laugh out of my story, said something about maybe I've been driving too long and should take extra care in travelling the remaining distance to home. When I got home, I retold my story to my family/friends. That ""understanding"" smile has been the usual reaction. But some have also said, ""Who knows? Maybe you did see Sasquatch!"". I finally convinced myself to report this to your site. Maybe I'll discover I wasn't the only one to see something extraordinary that night.",left lane of westbound lane near mile marker 222 on I-84 before the roadway goes thorugh the cut in the rock and crosses Patawa Creek,Pendleton,I-84,mile marker 222,45.588229,-118.619223,,NA,1745,NA,snowing,waning gibbous,97,"hillside , clearcuts , fields",NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,covered in hair,NA,leaning on guardrail watching traffic go by,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=5650

I was at the gravel watching over our two nieces who were wading around the water. The swimming hole is under a rail road bridge. The footings are cement. My husband walked around the cement, along the edge, to the back side. I walked the other way along the gravel where I found two indentations under the trees. The indentations looked like a sleeping place for a bear. But it was odd how they were so big and right in the open. Anyway, the girls were getting chilled and got out to dry in the summer sunshine. My husband came back about then, too. You should have seen the look on his face! He had that stare of disbelief and his face was drained of color. I asked what it was, what was wrong. He said he was just about to walk along the path, into to trees... What was that? Someone whispering? He didn't think anything of it but felt uneasy. He heard two someone's whispering again. He stopped moving and they stopped moving. He'd start moving and so would they. He thought someone was just playing around but felt so uneasy. About the 4th or 5th time of this red light green light game, he for no reason got the heebie jeebies. He said something just was not right and he felt like high tailing. He remained calm, and just backed out to the water's edge where I turned to climb the cement back. Any way, he was just telling me about the whispering and that he thought they were saying ""Look, who is that? It's --- (my husband's name)."" Something... he wasn't sure, but he did make out his name. He was telling me the story when this huge limb comes flying out from back there and hits the water with a splash. We looked at each other and back to the limb, as it floats down river. No one could have possibly thrown that, I thought. We were just talking of checking it out when we heard this huge splash back there. There was this kind of grunt along with it.

BFRO,Oregon,Umatilla,57323,Kevin Llewellyn,2012,November,NA,Winter,B,vocalization,NA,"November 2013 We live near the Umatilla River just 2-3 miles outside of Pendleton, OR on the Umatilla Indian Reservation. It is not a remote area. We are surrounded by farm ground and a couple neighbors within a couple thousand yards or so on a dirt road. We sleep with our bedroom window cracked about 2 inches open so the bedroom stays very cool. I awakened around 12:30AM and sat straight up in bed because I had heard something. It was very quiet in the house and no unusual noise outside but I had heard ""something"" that woke me up wide awake. Listening intently for several minutes, I heard this weird and very loud wailing, screaming, laughing noise that sounded like a cross between a woman hysterically screaming and then quickly changing to hyena-like laughing and almost a ""wooping"" yell. I jumped out of bed and ran to the front door that opens to farmland and low rolling hills. It sounded like several hundred yards out. It repeated 3-4 times, each getting quickly farther away like it was running. I did not awaken my spouse. A couple weeks later, the same thing occurred late at night. Then, a few days later around Christmas/New Years the local newspaper ran a story about ""Bigfoot"" scaring tribal members and people at night. There was also a large number of phone recordings of the same crazy maniacal laughter I had heard.

It was the last of October when he heard the first vocalizations and then again a couple weeks later in November, 2012. The witness was a biologist in fish and wildlife habitat recovery for twenty years. He is a hunter and did some trapping when younger. He describes the first vocalizations in his report but adds sometimes it was like a woman screaming, then up to one minute later similar to laughter. It varied from high pitched to guttural, almost like talk. It came from a field and at first seemed close, then farther away. It went on for one half hour. He has three neighbors within one half mile and he later casually mentioned if they heard anything and they said no. But the vocalizations would continue for over two months and many heard them. A couple weeks later, he heard the same vocalizations from the same field but 500 to 700 yards from the first spot. This was sometime between midnight and 3am and also lasted for one half hour. No odor was detected. He has twenty five fruit trees around his house and his neighbors have five to ten apple trees.

He hears coyotes almost every night. He has a chicken coop and 100 yards away from it is a den that fox have raised young over many years. The witness never hears them. I wonder why would foxes vocalize for two to three months in 2012 to 2013 but then he has never heard them any other time? The witness occasionally sees a cougar and has heard it many times. He said he thought about cougar as a source of the sounds but the vocalizations were too guttural. In summary, he said, ""this had a set of lungs that a fox does not have. It was of substantial size, a lot of air behind it."" Considering his professional background and the fact he tried to rule out other animals, I find him very credible.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=57323
BFRO,Oregon,Umatilla,65970,Kevin Llewellyn,2020,August,12,Summer,B,vocalization,activity,"My teenage sons and I were camping in a dispersed site off of NF-3102 for a few days. On the morning of the 12th just after 6am I was making coffee when I heard a guttural growling that rose to a higher pitch scream and then became a whooping sound, after which it dropped back down to a growl. This sequence repeated three times. My dog freaked out barking, but would not go past the saplings on the east edge of the camp, which is strange because he usually pursues deer, elk, and bears several hundred yards into the woods. I grabbed my bow and walked past the line of saplings, into an open forest that sloped down to a ravine with areas of dense vegetation. I called my dog to follow, but he would not come. The forest in this area is full of downed trees, where my sons and I had gathered firewood the previous afternoon. I believe the sound came from the vegetation / trees at the bottom of the ravine, which we had been within 30 feet of when gathering downed wood. I only walked about 20 feet past the saplings, and stood on a log for a better view, but did not see anything moving. I then decided to go back to camp, being a bit worried because my dog wouldn’t leave the area of our tent. For the next hour and a half I sat with my bow next to me, the dog sitting between my legs, and listened to many instances of downed branches cracking beyond the saplings. When the cracks stopped, it was abruptly, not fading as if the cause were moving away. These were large branches being broken, similar to the sound of a bear breaking wood. My dog is not afraid of bears and has chased away several, including one the previous week in eastern Idaho. About half an hour after the cracking sounds stopped the dog went out in the forest to investigate, and everything seemed to return to normal. It was then that I again heard the squirrels angrily chirping and chittering at the dog, and realized that I had not heard it at all during the noises or cracking. I have never heard anything in the Blue Mountains, Rockies, or Cascades like this sound. It sounded nothing like deer, elk, moose, bear, mountain lion, or bobcat. The only thing I could possibly think is maybe a mountain lion was killing an elk, but it repeated three times with just about the same length and cadence. And the whooping part of it reminded me of those plastic bellows hoses that you swing in the air to make a whistling / whooping sound. While in Pendleton a couple days later I was describing the sounds to a local hunter when an older native woman overheard and said she thinks it was a Bigfoot, and that she’s heard them on the Umatilla Reservation.",near NF-3102 before Red Saddle,Meacham,I-84,NA,45.4502371,-118.3243227,,4106,600,NA,clear,waning crescent,42,forest,"pine trees , fir trees",NA,NA,30,137.16,450.0,150,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"vocalizing , tree breaking",NA,NA,NA,"growl , scream , whoop",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,vocalized 3 times with 10s between each,1,"I talked to the witness by phone: The witness and his sons camped in many states the summer of 2020.

The ""driver"" (other hunter who was walking the mountainside to drive out a deer to the stander (me). The hunter I was expecting to see was my brother. I had a clear view of the mountainside-there was a lone pine tree with a fallen log in front of it. It was mid-morning, good weather-clear day and view. I was watching the mountainside when it walked into view. I assumed it was my brother because it walked like a man-upright. It was all in brown. In retrospect, I should have realized right away that it wasn't my brother because of the clothing. It stopped beside the tree and stood there. I had the feeling it could see me. I thought about putting my rifle scope on it, but thought my brother might not appreciate that,so didn't. After a few seconds, it dropped down to all fours & disappeared out of my view. That was when I realized it couldn""t have been my brother, so I thought it must have been a bear.

She appeared to have a high degree of aptitude with matters relating to hunting and local wildlife. She mentioned that at first she thought it was her brother who was in the approximate area ""driving"" deer to her stand. She stated that she did not think much of it immediately, since the creature nonchalantly walked upright along the side of the ridge with a gate ""very similar to a man"" and approached the pine tree, put its hand on the tree, and then turned to look at her. She described feeling very strongly at the time that the creature was looking straight at her. After a few moments of this behavior, the creature ""dropped to all fours"" and scampered with some degree of speed up the side of the ridge, out of sight. She said at that point she began to wonder if the creature was a bear, but noted that in all of her experience in the woods with bears she had never seen a bear “walk like a man"". She explained that she later wished that she had viewed the creature in her rifle scope, but since she initially thought it was her brother, she felt that ""he would not have appreciated her drawing down on him"". When her brother did approach the area adjacent to the pine tree shortly after the creature left, she described a sudden realization that this was a very unique experience in that her brother was much smaller in stature than the creature, and dressed in ""blue jeans and hunting jacket, not brown coveralls.""

Nearly every little diner and gas station seemed to have ""bigfoot"" plaster casts on the wall that ""were found 1 mile from here."" I thought it was all a big joke intended to boost tourism. I did NOT believe in Bigfoot. One Saturday we were looking for an out-of-the-way place to explore where we wouldn't run into anybody. We were driving down a remote track, maybe it was an old logging road, and finally had to stop when it crossed a large stream that was too deep for our little Geo Metro. Since we were miles from the last sign of civilization, and since we couldn't go any farther, we decided to do some exploring right there. I remember getting out of the car and immediately feeling an intensely eerie sensation of being watched. It was the kind of ""being watched"" that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I've never experienced that feeling either before or since. The really odd part was that I could pin-point exactly where I thought I was being watched from, even though I couldn't see anything. Just on the other side of the stream was a small, steep, tree-covered hill. The weird sensation of being watched was coming from a point about half-way up that hillside, probably 40 feet from the stream. I knew there wasn't anybody else out there because we were so far out in the wilderness, so I figured it was all in my head. We started poking around the streambank (the stream was probably 15-20 feet wide) looking for Indian artifacts, animal tracks, wildflowers, anything interesting. The ground was soft enough for our car tracks to leave a bit of an indentation in the ground, but too firm for us to leave any tracks. It was very grassy and weedy along the stream banks where we were. After about 20 minutes of poking around, I came across a huge footprint indented about an inch deep in the grassy ground. It looked like a flat-footed human print complete with 5 toes but it was approximately 16-18 inches long. And it made an indentation in an area where, at 150 pounds, we couldn't make ANY tracks. I couldn't believe I was really seeing this footprint, so I called my husband over to verify it. He confirmed that I wasn't seeing things. I briefly scouted around and found 2 more tracks but by this time I was really getting scared. Those huge tracks coupled with that eerie feeling of being watched nearly unnerved me. We practically raced each other back to the car, and by that time I was on the verge of panic. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I was also an instant believer in Sasquatch.

BFRO,Oregon,Wallowa,41634,Scott Taylor,1972,July,1-2,Summer,B,animal,NA,"On a family vacation in the remote mountains of eastern Oregon, I witnessed in broad daylight, what I believe was a family of sasquatches. I have recorded everything I can recall about that incident, hoping that others can extract important behavioral or other data from this report. I apologize for the abundant personal information – worry about the car, etc – but this information will help the reader understand why I can recall this incident so clearly. The sighting occurred in early July 1972 when my wife, 2 year-old daughter, 9 month-old son and I were on a vacation in Eastern Oregon, traveling in our Volkswagen Squareback. This was our first and only vacation to these regions. On the vacation, we visited the John Day River Valley, Strawberry Mountain, the Snake River Valley and other sparsely populated, remote mountainous areas. On the day of the sighting, I had decided to take a short-cut across the mountains expecting a scenic, but shorter route to Wallowa Lake, a resort area where we planned to camp. The region is thinly populated and the mountains are on Federal Lands but are essentially uninhabited. At the last gas station and general store before entering the mountains, I inquired if we could cross the mountains and was told the road was passable but primitive. This store may have been in the town of Cove or it may have been another town. We set off on our journey with a state roadmap and my sense of direction to guide us. After three or four hours of travel, several turns at unlabeled forks in the road and using the sun to navigate we found ourselves on a primitive dirt trail. We had not seen a house, vehicle or other sign of humanity for many miles. I became increasingly concerned realizing that if we broke down that I would have to walk possibly 20 miles or more to get help. In hindsight, I believe I may have wandered by accident into an area now designated as a Wilderness area where mechanized traffic is prohibited. Fortunately the day was clear and warm, and we were well below the level of any snow. We had food and water adequate for several hours, so we were in no immediate danger. I was driving and everyone else had dozed off. At about 2 PM we were driving generally north, quietly idling along at about 5-10 miles per hour, following a faint vehicular road. I call it a road for convenience, but it was not a road – it was a barely visible, badly rutted, dirt track without gravel, culverts or other improvements. It was basically a couple of ruts in the soil and looked as if it had not been maintained in decades, if ever. The soil was damp, but not wet so I had no concerns for traction. There were small bushes growing in the road. I recall realizing the traffic was only a few vehicle per year. The road was suitable for a heavy duty, 4-wheel-drive vehicle not a Volkswagen on a family outing. I became concerned that the road might dead-end or become impassable, and we would be forced to backtrack and I wasn’t sure I could find my way back. I had to keep a very close watch on the road to make sure I wouldn’t run over something that would damage our car and strand us in the middle of nowhere. At the sighting location the road was atop a wide, flat ridgeline covered with a few trees, bushes (possibly sagebrush) about 2 to 4 feet high and scattered clumps of bunch grass. The soil atop the ridgeline was thin and rocky. The damp soil suggested a possible rainfall a few days earlier. Based on the vegetation and lack of snow, I later estimated the elevation was between 4,000 and 6,000 feet. The ridgeline sloped gently to the left (west) and then dropped off sharply into a forested canyon, at a distance of approximately 125 yards from the road. To the right the ground gently sloped upward with a few scattered trees, and at a distance of perhaps 200 yards dropped off to the forested lower elevations. To the front, the road dipped down and then back up to the treeline about three quarters of mile ahead. Suddenly near the head of a small ravine which cut easterly from the canyon toward to the road, a human-like figure appeared about 200-300 yards ahead and a little to the left of the road we were traveling along (See Sketch 1). The figure hadn’t been there my last glance a few seconds earlier, so the figure must have been sitting or lying in the low bushes and then stood up. At first, I took the figure to be a hunter. In the context, a “hunter” is the most logical category for the figure. No other category – hiker, biker, nature lover, surveyor, rancher, fern gatherer, fur trapper, etc, etc – even remotely applied. My second thought was surprise because I couldn’t see a tent, pickup, camper or any other normal paraphernalia of a hunter’s camp. I wondered if the hunter had been hiking and had stopped to rest – that the hunter had a camp nearby and this was simply a place to take a mid-day break. I also wondered if hunting season was open this early in the year. Either way I didn’t care and gave a sigh of relief because I could talk to the hunter and ask if the road we were on would take us out of the mountains and back to the paved road. When I first saw the hunter, it was to the left of the road we were on (See Sketch 2). The hunter initially walked toward the road making me think the hunter was coming to the road to talk to me. However the next time I looked, there were 3 figures close together. They were not all the same height, which I interpreted as the shortest one being a child. They milled around and then all three began walking away from the road and toward the ravine. Still thinking they were hunters, I waved my arm out the window to indicate that I wanted to talk, but the figures continued walking toward the tree line and ravine to our left. I then saw a fourth human-like who was walking diagonally toward the ravine. While the hunters weren’t running, they were moving fast enough it was clear they would disappear to the trees before our car would get close enough that I could ask them a question. I wanted to speed up to catch them, but couldn’t because I had to keep checking the road to avoid hitting anything that might damage the car. The hunters continued to move away from the road instead of toward the road to talk. In frustration, I honked the horn and waved my arm out the window to signal the hunters that I needed to talk to them, but they kept walking their steady pace, without visibly speeding up or slowing down. The creatures I saw were definitely humanoid in shape – head, torso, two legs, two arms. They walked upright. They had a bulky appearance, but were not bears or any other four legged animal. I had mentally classified the creatures as “hunters”, but the classification did not fit very well. I thought it was too early in the year for hunting season (later confirmed). I did not see any sign of rifles, bows, quivers, backpacks, water jugs or other paraphernalia hunters normally carry with them. No vehicles or camp gear was visible. They were not riding horses. They were not wearing orange jackets, camouflage suits, chaps, hats or other clothing humans wear. They were uniformly dark in color from head to foot. They did not appear to be loggers, ranchers, forest service staff, mushroom pickers, horseback packers or any other type individual one might expect to see at this time and place. There was absolutely no gear of any sort visible. I briefly wondered if they might be military men on some sort of a training mission, but quickly discarded the idea because while military people sometimes dress in uniform dark colors, they always carry a lot of gear – weapons, ammo, food, radios, helmets, etc – and these creatures were not carrying anything. I also considered moonshiners or illegal marijuana growers but discarded the concept as not fitting these circumstances. About 20 to 30 seconds after the initial sighting as I was struggling to resolve these puzzling inconsistencies, I realized with a shock that maybe the creatures might not be hunters after all but were in fact sasquatches. I had seen the Patterson/Gimlin film a few years earlier but had mentally thrown it into a category of “don’t believe until there is more evidence”. Now in a flash I excitedly thought “They do exist! I’m looking at them! Sasquatches are real! Maybe that film wasn’t a hoax!” I shook my wife to wake her and began simultaneously telling her to wake up, get the camera out of the back seat, take a photo, count the creatures, and that I thought bigfoots were real and that we were seeing several of them. She couldn’t get awake fast enough to fully understand what I was trying to say or do any of the several tasks I was excitedly telling her to do. She did see the creatures but doesn’t remember the incident, since she had only been partially awake for about 15 seconds before the last one disappeared. Our car soon reached the point nearest where I had first seen the figures but by then all but one had disappeared into the trees. As the car reach Point B (See Sketch 2 & 3), I saw the last creature take a few steps just as it entered the tree line (Point 6). It had its back to me and didn’t look left or right as it walked into the trees and disappeared. The sighting was over. The creatures walked in a purposeful gait, not dawdling nor running. I don’t recall noticing anything special about their gait, height, posture or anatomy, beyond they were bulky. I heard no sounds and do not recall any strange smells, even though my window was down. At no point were we closer than about 100 or 125 yards to the creatures. The entire episode took perhaps 45 seconds. During this time, I could only look for a few seconds and then would look back to check the road to make sure I wouldn’t hit an obstacle. I absolutely could not afford to damage our car which could endanger my family. Before the realization dawned that these might be sasquatches, I was very irritated at the rude behavior of the hunters. All I wanted to know was if I could get back to civilization on the road I was on. These hunters had ignored the unwritten rule of remote areas to provide help to fellow travelers in need. Instead they had walked away and disappeared into the forest so they could selfishly continue their hunting. Or, so I thought. The behavior of the figures – remaining out of sight until the car was fairly close, standing up, milling around, and then walking briskly to the nearest concealment – did not match anything I have ever seen humans do. Humans in remote areas usually acknowledge the presence of each other and in my experience total strangers almost always say a few words to each other, especially when someone waves and calls to them. As we passed the area where the hunters had stood up, I considered stopping the car, getting out and yelling at the hunters / sasquatches to ask if the road would take us to the highway, but since they had ignored my arm waving and horn honking, and walked away it was clear they didn’t want to talk. I also thought of getting out and looking around where I had first seen them, but my wife who was fully awake by this time, didn’t want me to get out of the car. I realized that the creatures might indeed be bigfoots and I wasn’t sure what might happen if I left the car and gave the appearance of chasing them. My wife and I agreed it was critical to get my family off that mountain to safety before dark, so we did not stop. Despite the “flash of insight” that the creatures were sasquatches, I continued to be unsure of that conclusion. Such a conclusion was a huge step. How could I be sure the creatures were indeed sasquatches? The world is a big place and my understanding of all the possible explanations was so limited. This was my first (and only) visit to these mountains. Perhaps there was another explanation. What was clear, that I wasn’t going to get any more direct input from the creatures that had walked away without a word and disappeared. Then I thought of one last test I could apply to the sighting of the creatures. In my experience people always have clothing, gear, tools or other physical objects. So far as I had seen these creatures had none, but perhaps they were indeed humans and they had a base camp nearby where they had left their gear. We had seen no such base camp on the way to this location, but perhaps there was a camp somewhere ahead. The terrain constrained both foot and vehicular traffic to follow the ridgeline. If we saw a base camp in the next few miles with any kind of gear at all, then I would conclude that these creatures were just humans following some mighty strange practices. And maybe there would be someone in such a camp who could tell us if we could get back to the highway on the road we were on. I explained this to my wife, who by this time was fully awake. So for the next ten miles or so, we looked for such a base camp but saw nothing. For a couple of hours after the sighting we continued to drive generally north and came to progressively better roads until we got safely back to paved State Highway 82 where we turned right and drove on to Joseph, the town beside Wallowa Lake. I was very thankful to have completed the journey safely and to this day remain deeply thankful that my family was not stranded in the mountains. A few days later on the 4th of July, we visited my wife’s relatives on their large eastern Oregon ranch about 75 miles southwest of where we had seen the creatures. They and their ancestors had lived and grazed sheep and cattle for more than a century on their ranch in almost identical terrain with similar climatic conditions. I briefly described the sighting and asked if they had seen bigfoots in the Oregon. They responded that they had no personal experience of bigfoot, they didn’t know what was in California, but even if bigfoots existed in California, that they didn’t believe bigfoots existed in Oregon. Since I had recently married into the family and didn’t want to be labeled a nutcase, I dropped the subject. A couple of weeks later, I mentioned the incident to a co-worker, who also indicated non-belief. After that, I don’t recall thinking of or discussing the incident, until I prepared this report. I remain convinced we saw a group of sasquatches that day. I am glad to have a forum to present this report.

On the morning of this sighting, E.A. and the other two individuals got up at dawn and began scouting on foot. All three of them left camp in different directions. When E.A. reached the clear-cut that he mentions in his report, he saw the two creatures near the top and initially thought that they were bears. E.A. kept waiting for them to ""drop"" down to their front feet, but they never did. He watched them through binoculars at a range of approximately 300 yards. His sighting lasted about one minute. E.A. described both creatures as 5 1/2 feet tall, slender (no bellies), with long arms and long, slender fingers. Their coats were shaggy reddish-brown. E.A. remembered that their noses appeared human-like but their chins/jaw lines definitely did not. These were the only facial details that he couldsee. E.A. was so shaken up that the immediately went back to his camp, where he waited for his dad and other adult. Later that day, all three of them went back to the area of this sighting to look for evidence. E.A. was amazed because there were numerous mole holes in the ground, which offered piles of soft soil for quality impressions, but there were no tracks found. Eric believes that the creatures were cognizant of these areas of soft dirt and consciously avoided them. E.A. told a game warden the following year, while hunting elk in the same area. The warden apparently listened to his story buy made no formal report. This witness told me of another person he knows, who also hunts this same part of the state every year. This friend apparently saw a Bigfoot in 1995 at a distance of 100 yards. This was within 2 miles of E.A.'s earlier sighting.

BFRO,Oregon,Wallowa,24371,Richard Hucklebridge,2008,August,6,Summer,B,activity,footprint,"I drove up Mill Creek Road to Tiger Creek Road (also called Tiger Canyon Road) and stopped at Skyline Campground (formerly squaw springs campground). I live in western Washington but grew up in Walla Walla and love the Blue Mountains. I’m an avid hiker and love to enjoy the outdoors. When I get the time I like to make a hiking trip. I hadn’t been to this particular site before but I had heard some of the Sasquatch stories coming out of the Tiger Canyon area. I had driven up Tiger Canyon a couple times before, including a few weeks prior in late June when the road was still blocked by snow. I thought this campground would be the perfect place to stay the night and hike the area. A friend of mine had been with on the trip when the road was blocked, but he too was busy this week so I went alone to scout out the area alone, stay the night and drive back to western Washington the next day. I had first been intrigued by the idea of Sasquatch when I found some info online while searching for hiking sites. As a kid some local friends had told me stories, but I’d never been sure what to make of it. I also had read a book about Blue Mountain Bigfoot that Vance Orchard had wrote. I wasn’t totally convinced that these creatures existed and did not think I would find anything about them because I figured that if there were encounters, they were very rare. I arrived at the campground at about one o’clock. An older couple was there reading, enjoying the campground. I picked an area and began set up my tent. As I was pounding the stakes in I felt something hit the ground behind me. I turned around and I didn’t see anything. I looked over at the couple and they were still sitting at their campsite. Whatever it was had caused a very strong vibration in the ground behind me and it couldn’t have been anyone at the camp. A little bit later I started to hear a weird noise. At first I thought it was the antifreeze bubbling in my car because it was a hot day and my car was steaming a little. My car overheats a lot. The sounds were like a low rumbling growl. It was a sustained sound that lasted for just a couple seconds. However I seemed to hear it in regular intervals. The sound also seemed to kind of echo like the sound of something hollow or the sound of water down a drain which is why at the time I thought it was my car. I decided to explore the area; I walked by the two other campers and said hi. They had a poodle that barked at me little. I wanted to see if I could look over Tiger Canyon at the valley from where we were so I crossed over to the other side if Kendall Skyline Road. I couldn’t see much through all the trees so I decided to head the other way. I brought a GPS device with me that had topography maps loaded on it. It showed a trail into the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness that I wanted to follow. As I started in that direction I noticed a very large track just to the right of a pool of water in some soft mud. It didn’t really look to me as something authentically Bigfoot because the foot seemed thin. I told myself it couldn’t be a footprint of a Sasquatch because I had read some stories a few weeks earlier and thought I could just be imagining it. I came back and looked around the area behind the camp where I had felt the thump. I had heard something knocking on a tree so I tried to make noise like I had done when I was hammering the tent posts. I had a little pattern of sorts that I thumped onto the ground with a rock. It seemed like at one point whatever it was mimicked the pattern of my thumps. I explored the area I thought it was coming from, but only saw a deer, so I figured maybe it was just my imagination getting the best of me. The noises stopped and I felt relieved. “It was all just in my head” I thought. It was now somewhere between 1:30 pm and 2 pm, and I started down towards Squaw Spring. I noticed some more prints as I walked but I still didn’t believe what I was seeing. I found some that seemed to continue on further but I did not follow them since I had planned to go a few miles into the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness and didn’t want to waste time. It also looked like there was a foot impression on a log that had fallen across the spring. This all seemed too surreal to me because there were lots of prints everywhere even some that appeared smaller, possibly a juvenile animal, but they were just thin outlines. I had never seen prints like these in person so I was unsure what I was even looking at. I kept walking and came to a clearing on the side of a grade where I found a print that was about 3 inches deep and well defined. I could see the big flat foot, the toes and heel. Suddenly I thought wow these prints are for real. I now had a feeling one of these creatures could be around any corner. I got to the top of one of the mountains to get a nice view of the wilderness area and then made my way back to camp. When I got back I was pretty tired from hiking. The two other people at the campground left in their pickup shortly after I got there and I went to relax in my tent. I was the only one at the campground now. About an hour later I heard the same low rumbling growl sound from earlier. I realized that my car had now been off for 3 or 4 hours, and there was really no way it could be the car. I was hearing more knocking and like I had earlier. It sounded like someone was smacking a branch against a tree. I realized whatever creature this was; it must be the same one that came by before because the knocking and the low growl started at the same time after being silent for so long. It sounded like it was in the same area behind my campsite where I had heard the thump earlier. It was now about 7 pm, about 2 hours until dark. Being there by myself made me very nervous, especially with the growling noise and tree knocking apparently being directed toward me and my campsite. I got out of there as fast as I could. I got back to town and felt very paranoid. I spent time walking downtown Walla Walla calming myself down and recounting the events. I had never been so scared of the outdoors. People noticed I looked visibly shaken though I had not mentioned the incident. It was hard to even tell anyone in fear of them thinking I was crazy.",Skyline Campground (maybe Bone Spring Campground now?) off Kendall Skyline Road,Walla Walla,Kendall Skyline Road,Blue Mountains,NA,NA,,NA,1300,85,overcast,waxing crescent,28,forest,NA,NA,NA,390,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,growl,yes,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"This report was received in early August 2008, but due to the Georgia Bigfoot debacle; the report was put aside, because of how this witness felt about how people might view him and his story; which had just taken place up in the Blue Mountains of the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness area of Oregon. On the 10 of February of 2009 J.S. e-mailed me stating that he has decided that he would like to go ahead and tell his story which has caused him much concern after his short camping and field trip. I called J.S. as he requested. This young man, who is working in the computer world, seemed very credible in the retelling of his encounter last summer up in the Blue Mountains of Oregon; which is located just below the Washington and Oregon border. I never asked this witness for his GPS coordinates, because we will be giving the readers a small enough GPS location box that has all of the above-mentioned named places included. As of this date, this was the first and last possible encounter that this witness has had; which at first, he refused to accept as it was happening to him during his outing. After viewing all of those footprints that were close to where he had set up his camp; which by the way he didn't think were real at first. Not until he was on his short field trip into on the wilderness trail, about 3 miles out of camp, when he came up on what was an indisputable fresh print. He remembered that he had left his camera's memory card back in his car and was unable to take a photo. After rethinking his encounter, J.S. now believes that the sounds he was hearing and feeling were being made in the back of a throat of something that had to be very large, but as he looked around, he could never locate anything that was making those on and off growling sounds. After the two other campers left the area, and adding up all that was taking place, like the rhythm knocks and the throwing of small rocks that had landed just behind him, and the footprints that were seen; he finally made the decision to leave that camping spot and head for town to try and shake those fearful feelings that were still with him. This writer believes that this witness was in the presence of several of those Sasquatch creatures, and at first J.S. refused to believe that it was happening to him. First, the one that was throwing rocks behind him, and second when it was making those knocking sounds mocking the rhythmic thumps like J.S. was making when he was pounding in those tent stakes; I believe those were more than likely being accomplished by juvenile Sasquatch's that were probably playing with him. Note he had viewed many different sizes of tracks around his camping area, but they didn't look too fresh or real at the time. The Paul Freeman footage was filmed in this Blue Mountains region near the Washington/Oregon border. The area of this report was one of Mr. Freeman's favorite places, and is real close to where he got his short film. I now believe this footage to be of a real Sasquatch, after I had the chance to view his complete film. Mr. Freeman died in 2003. I am familiar with the area, back in 2000 I had the chance to camp at Deduct Springs, which is located on Tiger Canyon Road, a short distance down from Squaw Springs. We are enclosing two photos that were taken by this witness around his camping area, but this writer cannot say for sure that it is a Sasquatch track, but has some possibilities of being one. Let's face it photos of tracks are difficult to discern. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hey Richard, just wanted to send you these for the report. I attached to this email the pictures I took on the day of the encounter shortly after I got back to camp. Its somewhat easier to see if you rotate the picture to where the toes are pointing up. I wish I had gotten some casts and a picture of that print that was a lot more clear! (left my memory card in the car!) This track looked a little older (less fresh) and was closer to camp. J.S. P.S.

BFRO,Oregon,Wasco,8621,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1973-1974,August,NA,Summer,B,vocalization,NA,"Channel 2 News and becoming curious as one day long ago I heard sounds that to this day I can't identify. In August of 1973 or 1974 I believe, I was a twelve or thirteen year old boy scout on a scout camping trip at Camp Baldwin, Oregon. Another scout and I, in order to receive our 'camping merit badge', had to spend a night camped out in a tent away from the other scouts. We left the rest of the scouts to find our campsite, approximately 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile away from the main camp one late afternoon. We set up our tent, gathered the firewood for the night and cooked/ate our dinner. We sat around the campfire talking until we felt it was time to go to sleep, and retired to our tent and our respective sleeping bags. The boy I was with was quickly asleep but I was having trouble falling asleep. After what seemed like hours I finally started to drift off when I heard a sound in the distance that shook me bolt upright and wide awake. It sounded like nothing I had ever heard in my life, nor have I heard it since. I would estimate that it came from about a quarter of a mile away, in the opposite direction of the main campsite at Camp Baldwin. I've listened to the recordings of the vocalizations on your website and this sounded a bit different. It began as a low guttural sound that grew louder and higher in pitch until it sounded very similar to your recordings, high pitched and kind of warbling, before dropping in pitch and dying off quickly. Each vocalization lasted approximately 7 or 8 seconds. I listened to this sound repeat many times for probably an hour, maybe a little less, with my head buried in my sleeping bag not making a sound. The sound seemed to get closer at times, but never sounded close enough that I thought we were within its eyesight. Still, fear kept me from making a sound, even to wake up my tent mate, and I just lay there listening and trying to remain as motionless as possible. Eventually the sounds quit and what seemed like an eternity later I finally fell asleep. I am 42 years old now and have spent my life in the Oregon woods, fishing and the like. I have still yet to hear anything that even remotely sounds like what I heard that night. Was it Bigfoot? I have no idea as it did sound somewhat different than the recordings you have on the site.

BFRO,Oregon,Wasco,9785,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1971-1994,NA,NA,NA,A,animal,NA,"I have lived on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation all of my life, and I have had three 'run ins' with Bigfoot. The first one was when my first daughter was about 2 years old, and we lived at my father's home at a place called Wolf Point. Back then (1971) it was the only house out there, and the house had a large sliding glass door that went out to the back porch. Back then, the glass doors were only 1 pane, and we had only a thin white sheet to cover it with at night. It was about 2:30 a.m. when I woke to hear my daughter giggling in the dining room. I walked down the dark hallway, and came around the corner and I was about to tell Diane that it was too late to be playing around, when I saw why she was giggling. We had forgotten to tack the corner of the sheet back up, so the sheet was only hanging by one tack, and the window was wide open, with the back porch light on. On the porch, there was a small bigfoot standing directly in front of the door, and it was jumping off the porch, then it would jump back up and my daughter would giggle and jump up and down. I could only stand there and watch, but I felt so scared I wanted to just grab my baby and run! Then it saw me and jumped off the porch and disappeared from my view. That seemed to break me, because I screamed ""DIANE!"" and she spun around and looked at me. Then I saw what I assumed to be the mother bigfoot walk by the window. I lunged and grabbed my daughter's arm, picked her up and ran back down the hall. My dad came out and asked what was going on, and I told him. Being a very traditional Native American man, he got mad at me for allowing my daughter to ""play"" so late at night, and told me to go back to bed. He said that Bigfoot have travelled and protected our people for many generations, and they meant no harm to us, if we leave well enough alone. The second time was when I was pregnant with my fifth child. Again, I was living out at Wolf Point at my dad's house, but he no longer lived there, and had left his house to all his children after he remarried. I didn't see it this time, but our dogs were barking up a storm, and I remember my Mexican husband (not believing in Bigfoot) telling me that it was only the cattle or horses that wander around the area. Then the sound intensified, and whatever it was was hitting the rain gutters outside. It wasn't trying to pull it down, it was as if it was trying to intimidate the dogs with it's size or something. It intimidated me!And finally, my husband and my two younger brothers went hunting for rabbits in the Wolf Point area hills. They were all talking and not really doing a good job ""hunting"" when my husband looked up and saw about 100 yards away a figure standing in the distance. It was an open range with only juniper trees. They had been on the plateau, and he assumed it was a horse standing facing them, so that it appeared to two legs only - until it turned sideways and walked very fast away from them. My husband only described disbelief, being from Mexico and not really ever believing my stories. Then they all started chasing it! It went over a hill and they continued running their fastest after it, until they reached the point where it left their sight. He said he abruptly stopped, because they were on a cliff that went straight down. He described them looking for a trail or a ledge that it must of gone down, but there was nothing. It just disappeared over the cliff. He became a believer ever since.",private residence near Wolf Point in the Warm Springs Native American Reservation,Warm Springs,Hwy 3,Warm Springs Native American Reservation,NA,NA,,NA,230,NA,NA,NA,NA,"forest , river , mountains","sage brush , juniper trees",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,smaller sasquatch playing with daughter through glass door,NA,jumping up and down,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,"The witness lives on the reservation and is a full-blooded member of the Warm Springs Tribe.

When her small daughter effectively ""played"" with the small sasquatch, the girl was somewhere near three feet, while the sasquatch was about a foot taller. The witness used to have a pitbull, who was found one day dead with its back broken backwards, but no open wounds of any kind. One time, when some of her relatives were hunting, they observed a sasquatch in the open country and pursued it in a pickup truck. On that occasion the sasquatch ran parallel to the road, looking at them, rather than veering off at right angles. The witness also mentioned that in the event of visitors coming to the Wolf Point residence, she would hear rock clacking nearby in the darkness. She mentioned that apparently a sasquatch travels through the more developed area of the reservation to this day and empties out garbage cans without tipping them over, as bears or dogs do.

A retired project engineer from Portland now living in Roseburg. Articulate, knew the area of the sighting very well and the details of his description match my knowledge of the area. He got a pretty long look, he says. His son flushed the animal from its hiding place while elk hunting on a cold November day in the White River drainage, a tributary of the Deschutes River. Witness was watching his grown son from a distance as he was traversing a steep open hillside as part of their elk hunt. His son did not see the animal he flushed as he was moving the other way from the animal's subsequent motion. The witness states that his son was near enough to use as a size comparison. He insists that the animal he saw walked upright but was shorter than his 6-foot tall son, and he estimates that the animal he saw was 5'6'' in height, but it otherwise was identical to 'Patty' in the PGF which he had seen subsequently on calbe TV shows. The animal he saw took long strides (much longer than human), and walked with a stooped-over posture, bent knee gait that was very atypical of humans. Assuming he is correct about height, one might suppose he saw a juvenile sasquatch. He saw only the one animal, and no sights or sounds to suggest that there were others in the vicinity. No details he observed suggested gender of the animal. He was holding a rifle with a scope attached and during the minute or so that he watched the animal walk quickly away, he was so overcome with stunned disbelief that he did not think to raise his rifle and look through his scope, much less consider firing his rifle.

BFRO,Oregon,Wasco,698,Dr. Wolf H. Fahrenbach,1993,February,NA,Winter,A,animal,NA,"Dr. and Mrs. E. were riding in their private sleeping compartment in the train from Chicago to Portland, a near annual event to visit relatives in Portland. He was closely watching the clock, since the train had left with a delay and, consequently, needed to make numerous, unscheduled stops to let other trains pass. With admirable honesty they admitted to them both having been near naked. During the afternoon, about 2 pm, the train made an unscheduled control stop about 10 minutes train travel West of the Dalles, OR. Looking diagonally into a snow-covered clearing in the woods between the train and the Columbia River, they saw a dark sasquatch stepping into the clearing, accompanied by several ""dark birds"" of an unidentified species. The sasquatch hunkered down to look at the train, and got up once or twice to walk a few steps and hunker down again. The hair on its legs stuck out on the surface of the snow ""like bellbottom pants""; when hunkering, its arms were outside its knees and it rose without assistance from the arms or hands. The E.'s felt secure within the train and were not seen by the sasquatch [tinted windows]. They could exchange mutual questions over the 8-minute period that the train stopped, verifying their mutual impressions of its reality and configuration. Contrasty lighting precluded detailed viewing of features of the animal. The conductor admitted obliquely to seeing it, too, but the geometry of the terrain precluded viewing by others in compartments ahead or behind that of the E.'s. They could not alert others during the event because of their dishabille. The train left with the sasquatch watching. They both stated their absolute conviction that what they saw was a sasquatch.",10 minutes by train west of Dalles,Dalles,NA,Columbia River,NA,NA,,NA,1400,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,sat down in snow to watch a train,NA,NA,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,"Dr. and Mrs. E., and a middle-aged dentist and his younger wife; the conductor for their section of the train. COMMENTARY and CONJECTURE: The accompanying birds have been mentioned before and no explanation presents itself. The E.s did not suggest that the birds were ""mobbing"" the sasquatch. They thought they were smaller than crows. The ""bellbottom"" effect of the hair on the legs speaks of considerable length, probably 4-6"". The circumstances are again an example of a sasquatch being seen as a consequence of its own curiosity. The area of the Dalles has been the site of repeated sightings over the years and has been conjectured to be an area where sasquatch cross the Columbia by swimming. The Columbia in this area is relatively narrow, but cold, deep, and very rapid. The E.s discussed the sighting in detail with the Bigfoot Research Project and presented their encounter to the Sasquatch Biology class, held at Portland Community College during the next year, and freely answered questions from the audience. It appears that having been confined to the train provided the eyewitnesses with an unusual state of psychological and physical separation and security, which permitted them to assess the creature with calm detachment and objectivity, unsullied by proximity-induced anxiety.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=698
BFRO,Oregon,Wasco,26718,Will Robinson,2009,October,5,Fall,A,animal,vocalization,"in october of 2008 i was hunting in the white river unit. after being camped for three days i was sitting at the camp fire with my father at around 1:00am when we heard this sound like we have never heard in our life of being in the woods, it sounded almost exactly like one of your recordings except a little bit higher pitched. we heard this sound about every three to thirty minutes until we decided it was getting a little to close for our comfort and went to the dalles for breakfast at about 2:30 am. we came back the next morning and finished out the hunting season without anymore odd noises. so needless to say we drew the same tag this season. so three days into the hunt being October 5th 2009 me and my best friend decided to go hunt a canyon that was across road 4430 from our camp at around 8:30am. As we were driving about 60 yards down the road, we see a black creature that i would say to be around seven feet tall come running up the the steep bank and across the road at an unhuman speed. about 10-15 feet behind it another creature of the same size and color came running across at an ever faster speed. Needless to say i gunned it to try to get closer to get a better look at what i had just seen. within about 10mseconds they were long gone into the manzanita bushes. i got out of the truck and was listening and could hear nothing at all. with the hair on my neck standing up and goose bumps me and my friend went back to camp and started telling my father what had just happened. He found it comical and thought that we were trying to mess with him until that night when my friend was almost in tears begging to leave the woods. we ended up packing up camp and going home at 10:30pm. so last night me and my father started looking up info. and sightings on bigfoot in the area. After reading all of this we started putting things together, and decided to go back today and look for clues. the first thing that really caught out eyes was reading of their stench. less than 500 yards from whare i saw the creatures cross the street were were cutting wood the day before and noticed a rotten small that we had smelled about 5 years before when camped by there. so we decided to go look for tracks and to see what was making the bad smell. so when we go there we decided to go look for the smell first. Its strongest point ended up being down this grown over cat road about 400 yards. we could find nothing that would be causing the smell but the one thing that really gave my goose bumps was there was small trees about three inches in diameter snapped about two feet up laying across the road where the smell was the most potient.(I read the night before to watch for small broken trees. after not finding anything that could be causing this smell we decided to go look for tracks where they crossed the street. after looking for about twenty minutes we found what look like a long and wide print that had no distinguishable toes or tread. about 15ft from the print we found some feces that were what i thought to be a bear but my dad said noway so needless to say i now have a bag of s*&t that i have no idea what it came from. now to describe the figures we say run across the road. they ran completely upright and at speeds of a deer. i could not really see its face. it had longer arms that than a human and ran straight armed. and last it was solid black",White River Unit,Dufur,NA,White River Unit,NA,NA,,NA,830,NA,NA,waning gibbous,98,forest,pine trees,NA,NA,0.1666666667,54.86,180.0,60,NA,2,7,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,black,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,long,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,road crossing,NA,"road crossing , ran with striaght arms",bipedal,scream,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,"I spoke with the witness on the phone.

In the previous year he heard several vocalizations throughout the night, until he and his dad left the camp to go into town. No other activity happened that trip.Then the following year they sighted two, 7-8 foot, black, hairy, bipedal, upright walking creatures. He said that one of the things that he remembers the most was how fast and nimble they were going up very steep terrain, which would have been impossible for a human to accomplish. They left later that night because a member of their party no longer wanted to remain in the woods. He and his father returned a few days later to look for evidence of what they saw. There were small trees placed across the road and when they got out to investigate they encountered a strong odor that was only in the area of the broken trees. They continued to look around the area and found possible footprint impressions, but they lacked detail. They followed these footprints for a short while and found a large scat. I attempted to reach the campsite where the events took place but due to recent snowfall the area is impossible to reach until next spring.

The witness rode into this area from a private road. She said, ""they were quiet on horseback."" She saw it first and tried to determine what it was. It seemed to be picking at something, but was not carrying anything when it moved. It looked at her and her horse and then stood up. It sprinted up a steep hill on two legs. She saw arms swing. She could see it go through the trees. It was about six feet tall, very dark brown to black. At that distance the face only seemed flat, no bear nose seen. She did not detect any foul odor. The dog did not have any unusual odor when it came back. While this area is populated, it has a mix of farms, hay fields and orchards. It is the northern end of the Chehelam Mountains. The witness had seen cougar in this area. She now lives in Alaska and observes bear often.",NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=64019
BFRO,Oregon,Washington,1829,NA,2000,October,NA,Fall,A,animal,NA,"It was dark. I was driving my truck going South on hwy.219 out of Hillsboro. I had the truck's bright lights on. I was scanning the countryside for wildlife as is my practice. I've seen hundreds of deer and a number of elk over the years.(Not necessarily in this location.) But, what I saw that night, made my mouth drop open. I saw a very tall, shaggy golden brown animal with two very long legs. Its' arms were hugging its' sides. It was standing as still as a tree as the headlights hit him. My first impression was ""THAT is the biggest deer I have ever seen in my life!"" But, even though it was looking directly into the headlights, the eyes were not reflective. It had no antlers, and as I got closer I saw that it didn't have hind legs or a horizontal body attached. It was taller than an elk and much, much taller than a white tail deer. I would estimate that it stood approx. 8' tall. It had a good build (well proportioned)The hair seemed to be about four inches long and covered all the body except for the eyes. The head was round on top with little or no neck. The face appeared flat and the nose was small enough not to be noticed. The hair had a slight wave to it. It did not lay flat. To tell the truth, it looked a lot like Chewbaca (sp?) from Star Wars. It was standing in a field about 2-3 pickup lengths from the road,facing the road at an angle in such a way that my headlights hit him straight on as I approached, and I could see him from the side as I passed him. I was going 55 MPH so I saw him for only seconds. But the image is etched in my brain! I've thought about this since the day it happened and can figure out nothing else that it could be other than a sasquatch. I finally decided to report it.","From Hillsboro, take hwy. 219 south. Jackson Bottom Slough is just a little ways past the railroad tracks. From the Jackson Bottom Slough sign, continue on hwy. 219 for exactly 1.5 miles to a field that is just opposite where Tongue Rd. intersects with 219.

BFRO,Oregon,Washington,3209,NA,2001,October,14,Fall,B,footprint,NA,"I was hunting the Wolf creek Rd area. 3.5 miles up the road is a clearing. I decided to walk down into the timber stand about 1/2 mile down the side of the slope. The path then cuts right and follows the wood line and the creek at the bottom. I am always looking for any signs of our big friend. I am involved in ongoing research in the Salmonberry area, so my eyes are always scanning. About another half a mile up the trail I caught sign of pretty big print. I measured the print to the following dimensions. 17 inches long 6 inches wide Could count all five toes in the print I am 282 pounds and left no impression in the soil. This print left a 1-inch depression in the soil. In scanning the immediate area I could see the trail it followed up from the creek bed. The print was heading in the westerly direction down the trail where I was heading. No odor was detected and no scat was found. Foliage in the area was low to the ground so I observed no broken tree limbs at an unusual height. I will be returning this weekend with some fruit and will try to work more of the bottom of the timberline and see what can be found deeper into the tree line.",Rt 22 west to Wolf Creek Rd. 3.5 miles up the road in the clearing on the right hand side.,Vernonia,Rt 26,NA,NA,NA,,NA,1530,65,partly clear,waning crescent,8,"clearing , forest , creek",NA,NA,NA,NA,0.30,1.0,0.3333333333,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,print heading west,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,1,NA,17,6,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,5,NA,NA,NA,1,Robert is an experienced outdoorsman and has been investigating bigfoot reports in this area ofthe CoastRange in NW Oregon for about one year.,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=3209
BFRO,Oregon,Yamhill,703,NA,1984,May,NA,Spring,B,vocalization,NA,"It was May 1984. Two friends and I were up in the hills nw of Yamhill, OR, late in the evening, around 10:30 pm. We heard the scream, a VERY low, very long howl. Not a coyote, bear or cougar. Have heard all of them before. This was nothing like anything I have ever heard. I still remember thinking to myself ""How in the hell can something make such a low howl."" It scared us at first, but is sounded like it was far away, like maybe a mile or so. We were drinking a little beer, so after awhile we relaxed and forgot about it. It must have been about a half hour later when we heard it again. I swear that it had to be within 30 yards of us. Same loud, low howl, but MUCH closer. And it sounded pissed. I could feel the sound vibrations bouncing off the back of my neck. The hair stood up on the back of all of our necks. All of us turned white as hell, and our jaws dropped past our knees. The howl seemed to say ""GET OUT!"" Which is EXACTLY what we did. I just looked at the two other guys and said ""lets get the @#$ outta here "". We did not see anything, but felt the presence. I grew up within 10 miles of that spot. I had never heard that sound before, or since, EXCEPT on a television show that had a report of a bigfoot sighting. A guy in Idaho caught one on video (at least it looked like one), but when I saw the video, I heard that scream again. The guy taking the video threw the camera in the ditch, and hid. It was the SAME scream. ONLY other time that I have EVER heard it. It was EXACTLY the same scream. I saw this video on a news show, something like ""Real TV"" while in Fairfax, VA, in 1992 or 1993. I do not know EXACTLY what it is that we heard, but I know what I think it was. Bigfoot.
