Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage, there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house. We took off at probably 11 pm, rode up the road about a quarter mile, and cut off on the trails. It had snowed about 10 inches a few days before so there was fresh snow, with no tracks. I was leading the way for about a half hour, then we stopped and talked for a little bit. We took off again and kept cruising on some sort of game trail that led to an opening in the woods. I rode off into the opening with my friends following about fifty yards behind me. I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down. I figured it was just a moose or something. But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot. It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me. It was running in the opposite direction. I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind. It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness. I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said ""We need to get out of here,"" and rode back towards my house. When I told them about it back near my house, they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods. But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else. The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn't anything human.

I didn't think much of it, as me and my friend have done it many times before. There were four of us, and we set out at about 11 o'clock at night. It was rather dark, but there was light from the moon. The weather was rather cold, as we did this in the winter. The area we walked on was game trails (trails that moose walk on) as well as trails used for mushers, runners, cross country skiiers, and that sort. We had walked about 2 miles from my house to another entrance where most people enter. On the way we had talked about unexplainable events or things such as bigfoot, and UFOs. When we reached the bridge where most people come in, one friend had smoked a cigarette. We then saw a light and decided to go on. On the way back, we heard wild dogs barking wildly, and decided to pick up the speed. It eventually became a sprint, whereafter we walked. When we walked, we continued talking about it. It was then I had realized, some thing had been following us, as well as testing us, or even harassing us. It was much earlier, I just didnt think about it. I had thought it was my friend Warren, who is sometimes clumsy. I had thought it was him who had made noises such as slipping, but it was really something throwing stuff at us. I had realized this about half way back. I asked if Warren kept slipping, when he told me it wasn't, and he thought I could have been pulling a prank. We stopped for a minute to listen when I told the others something strange was going on. We stopped, and shone a flashlight around, hearing noises such as steps, and branches moving and breaking. The leader had thought I had been playing a joke when I told him seriously, I wasn't. He decided to walk behind with me, when something threw snowballs, and nearly hit us on many occasions. It was then he realized that this was no joke, and we picked up a light jog, for most of the way. When we were almost out of the woods, we had again heard dogs, and maybe 20 ft away, the branches breaking, and again, something throwing stuff at us. By the time we left, it was about 3-3:30 in the morning. I did not go directly to my house because I didn't know if it was still following us. I know this was not a prank because the snow is more then 5 ft deep in the woods, and someone would have a extremely hard time to play a prank like that.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"throwing snowballs , branch breaking , stalking",NA,NA,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,"Chugach Mountains, moon 85% full",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=8792

I am an avid outdoorsman, hunter and someone who just loves to get out there. Every year after fishing, I try to take a trip up river with a friend or two to wind down and enjoy ourselves before we go home. This year while I was on this trip into Alaska's interior our main mission was to take pictures of bears and the surrounding wildlife to promote a new bear viewing and sports fishing buisness. While on our five day trip, we spotted more than fourty bears. I took hundrends of pictures of these bears and their tracks. One of which, was so big, it put chills up my spin and gave me and my companions a very uneasy sense of insecurity. What set this track apart from the others was it's enormous size and human shape. In one of the pictures that I took of this track, I placed my foot next to it on the ground, keep in mind I am wearing a size 13 boot. Whatever made this track was so heavy, heavier than the biggest bear, that it pushed the gravel so far into the earth that it made us truly speculate what we were looking at. Other pictures that we took of bear tracks were nowhere close to the indentation that this track had left. One of the most intriguing things about this track was there were no visible claw marks as with all the other bear tacks. Both of us felt extremely uneasy of our surroundings and had the feeling that we were being watched. For the rest of the day we didn't have much to talk about, and that night felt uncomfortable at camp. We never heard or smelt anything out of the ordinary. To this day I'm not too sure what we saw and I'm not making any claims other than the words I have put fourth.

It was on the base of a steep mountainside in bare, rocky terrain, with snowfields descending down the small gullies on the hillside. It was moving up the valley about a half mile away. When it crossed the snow, you could plainly see that it was not a bear. It walked upright with long strides and arms swinging and moved fast across the white snow. It was dark in color like a bear. I have seen bears many times since in the same type of terrain and they do not move like this did. It was too big and fast to be a human. Bears can and do walk upright, usually for short instances when they need to see or smell something and need the height. They don't travel in this manner and not in difficult terrain.

Although it's quite close to the Fairbanks area and there are many houses and roads in the main part of Goldstream, the side valleys are still as wild as they were a thousand years ago. I was hunting ruffed grouse in one if these side valleys (I prefer not to say which one). I was on a south-facing aspen covered hillside, and had hunted all afternoon and evening, intending to spend the night out on the hill and hunt my way back in the morning. As I was making camp, a black bear almost walked right into me. I heard him coming from a ways off, and scared him away before he got closer. later on, it will become apparent why I mention this. So I was sleeping out in the open, no tent, under a spruce tree. Sometime in the middle of the night, I was awakened by something prowling around my camp, maybe thirty feet or so away from me, walking in a circle. I mentioned the bear before. . . this was not a bear I heard in the night. My father is a hunting guide, and I literally grew up hunting bears. I KNOW what a bear sounds like when it's walking. Whatever this thing was, it was walking on two legs, with a bit of a shuffling sound between each step, like it was dragging its feet a bit. The leaves on the forest floor were dry like potato chips, and it was breaking a lot of branches--I could hear it and follow its movement quite distinctly. I have to say here that I've spent a LOT of time in the Alaskan bush, and have never before or since been truly afraid of anything I've encountered, but I don't mind saying that on that particular night I was literally shaking with fear. It circled my camp for what seemed like hours, but it was probably only five minutes or so. Finally, remembering something I had once read about the Athabascan Indians' beliefs regarding ""woodsmen"", I started talking to it, albeit in a shaky voice, saying I wanted no trouble that night. The thing stopped dead in its tracks, then a few moments later, I heard it trotting downhill, away from me. Talking to such a creature may sound kinda cornball, but all I know is that it worked. I've kicked myself for this many times since, but the next morning, I didn't bother to look for any tracks, hair, etc. I just packed up and resumed my hunting. I had no further trouble with the woodsman. As a final couple of notes, I do recall hearing kind of low muttering sound as it was prowling around me. Also, having since done some reading on Bigfoot sightings, I've noticed that a lot of people report the animal having a strong foul odor to it.

I was heading south on Auburn Dr toward Farmers Loop which was about 1 mile away. It is a wooded area frequented by homes and in general would be considered a populated area. Houses are on an average of about 100 to 200 feet apart with only the general area around and close to the homes cleared out. Most of the area by far is wooded. It was the section of the road where it passes by Pearl Creek Elementary school. The school can be seen through the woods. Some of the woods in the area are quite thick and in some places can’t be seen into more than about 10 or 15 feet. But in this area, it had apparently been cleaned out quite a bit and sightlines into the section of the sighting were very open. The school and vegetable garden could be seen off to the right from the road I was on. It was about 6pm and I was heading home after a day of working on a deck I was building. The weather was clear with the sun high in the sky. As I was driving, I happened to notice a “man” standing by the right side of the road about 100 yards ahead. It was more of an unconscious recognition. There’s nothing unusual about a man standing on the side of the road in this area. As I got to within about 50 yards, I looked closer. “That’s no man” I said to myself (I was alone in the car). Shortly after that, 1 or 2 seconds, he bolted into the woods towards the school. He did it like a wild animal would do if spooked. I didn’t slow down until I got to the place where I saw him go into the woods which is where I stopped. I could see him running away from the road and when he was into the woods about 30 yards or so, he turned left and was now running parallel to the road in the same direction I was heading. I got a good look at him, but not his face. I could have probably seen his face had I not been so mesmerized and had the presence of mind to look at it. I was busy noticing other things. His fur or hair looked to be about 3 to 4 inches all over the main part of his body. It was a reddish rusty color. I was mildly struck by how red it was, but it definitely had some rustyness to it. He was about 6 feet tall and looked to weigh about 200 lbs. He ran with a strange “Hoppy” kind of run. It wasn’t a limp. With one foot he pushed off with was more a normal running move, but the other foot he pushed off with propelled him upward (about a foot or less) and forward. I watched him until he disappeared into the woods. There was a road about 100 yards ahead and I took off to get to it so I could turn right and in 20 yards turn right again to the road that lead to the school parking lot. So the wooded area he was in was sort of a peninsula and he seemingly had to be in there somewhere. The woods I was looking into from that angle were quite thick and I didn’t see him and haven’t seen him since. A little farther up on the right was the school garden that had people in it (around 7 - 10) which I’m now sorry I didn’t stop to go talk to them about it. The next day as I was driving in to work on the deck, I naturally slowed down in the area I saw him (stopped actually) and was surveying the area when a couple walking their dogs were approaching. I flagged them down and told the story of what happened the evening before and they told me that about a week before they were with their dogs and were on the way other side of the school property by the soccer field and 3 kids came running over to them saying “Did you see the sasquatch, did you see the sasquatch.” They also said that what appeared to be a Dad was with them who didn’t seem to excited about it. My conclusion to whether it was real or not is summed up by saying. “It was either real or there was a man in a VERY, VERY convincing costume.” I reported it to the fish and game office in Fairbanks a couple days later.

The witness didn't get a good look at the creature's face or its feet. He described the shape of the head as being a cross between that of a human and a gorilla. The hair on the body seemed to be fairly uniform in length, about three to four inches, and was not matted or scruffy looking. 3. He has no explanation for the unusual gait of the creature, and could not speculate as to the possibility of an injury or deformity that might cause it. 4. The witness says he is inclined to believe what he saw was a real non-human animal, but it was definitely not a bear. He recognizes that there is a remote chance that someone could have been carrying out a hoax, but he indicated that if it was someone in a costume it was so convincing that it would have to be a costume of Hollywood-professional quality.",yes,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=26604

With hunting season not to open until the day after next, we were in no hurry and enjoyed the evening with a touch of good single malt Irish talking about our past hunts and the one we were about to have. Loyd and Davis would not arrive until the first day of the hunt, presumably because Dave had become domesticate sometime after the previous year’s hunt and had to attend a retirement party before being allowed to leave Valdez for camp. With the evening expended and the toll the day had taken on us we were in our sleeping bags and doubtlessly turning logs into sawdust by 2300 hours. The stove was stoked with fresh firewood and all was good. About 0215 I awoke feeling way too warm, unzipped my bag, slinging the top off, when I heard a resounding crack of wood striking wood, similar to a Louisville Slugger solidly striking a large, sound Birch tree very close to the cabin. There being no one within many miles of us, my attention was immediately focused on the sound. A few seconds later, the sound was repeated, which was to be the pattern for several minutes while I attempted to evaluate it to determine its source. I finally decided to wake Bill saying in just above a whisper, “hey Bill”. He stirred responding with something that sounded like “what” and did not move again for twenty minutes; when he woke up and asked what was going on. In the mean time the commotion stopped when I initially attempted to awaken Bill up and I was sitting on the bunk with my .450 in hand waiting for whatever eventuality might arise. Nearing 0300 hours I finally returned to a sound slumber awaking well into the following morning. With a spot of coffee in our gullets and having explained to Bill the events of the previous night we explored the area of the old village, inclusive of the nearby grave yard, in an effort to find an explanation. We found numerous paths traversing the grassy area around the cabins with a multitude of bedding sites. Never did we find anything that would provide us with an answer to the question of the source of sounds. Explaining this to another friend after our return, with the experience of spending many years living in numerous villages, he asked me if there was a native graveyard nearby. It is less than 50 yards from the cabin.

The area, according to Ed, was known for its concentration of berries and black bears. The salmon run was in the early starting stage. Solid forest was estimated to be about 100 miles away. Ed did not have even a shadow of a doubt about the identity of the animal he had seen, particularly since he had previously hunted many of the large game animals of Alaska. Hair of the described appearance can be estimated to be 18-24"" long. The interest of this sighting with its rather meager contents lies in its geographical latitude. The center of Prince William Sound lies at 60 degree, 40 minutes N. Additional Alaskan sighting reports are to be found in Green (1978), and in an article in the magazine ""Alaska"" of October, 1995, pp. 25-27. Aside from reports in the Alaska Panhandle, e.g., near Hyder, Ward Cove on Prince of Wales Island, and in the Wrangell Narrows (by Bob Titmus himself), all in the vicinity of 56 degrees N., there are scattered sightings farther north. On the Alaska Peninsula, a cluster of sightings have been recorded near Chignik Lake (55 degree, 54 minutes N), Manokotak near Kulukak Bay (58:40 N), Togiak drainage (59 N), Lake Iliamna (59:30 N), and yet farther north near Galena, 120 miles inland from Norton Sound (64:44 N) and Kotzebue Sound at the Arctic Circle (66:33). All of these sites are on the coast or within ready sasquatch walking distance of it and are, consequently, moderated by the ocean. Such cannot be said for inland sightings, such as that near Fort Yukon, south of the Brooks Range, or Dawson Creek (NE British Columbia; detailed in Hunter and Dahinden, 1993). Both of these locations are exposed to the full brunt of the arctic winter. Seasonal migration would appear to be of immediate advantage in these regions as compared to the overall temperate Pacific Northwest, though unlikely to be established in view of the rarity of these events. In any case, large bulk and long hair would be of decided survival value.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=1261

Instead of being rewarded with owls responding to my calls I heard a scream or moan about three quarters of a mile away like I had never heard before. I asked my friend what in the hell was that? He replied that it was probably what some of the old farmhands referred to over the years as the hairy man, which some of them had told of seeing from time to time for many years. I hooted once again and the same scream replied only closer this time. We stood there a little longer and could hear something big coming up the hill through the woods very quickly. By the time we got into the truck we were treated to another hair curling scream still in the woods but getting close to the hayfield. We cranked the truck and drove as fast as we could thru the bumpy field. When we arrived at the gate my friend asked me to get out and close the gate so that nobody could trespass onto the property. The gate was a quarter to a half a mile away from where we were run out of the field. As I opened the truck door to get out I was treated to yet another scream from the hay field. The gate did not get closed that night. What this was I do not know. I know that there was no livestock kept in this part of the farm. I do know that if this thing were discovered and somehow befriended that it would be a great asset to the U.S. Olympic team, for neither Jesse Owens or Carl Lewis can run cross country like this thing.

I was 11 years old at the time. We lived in a trailer on hurricane rd. and my grand parents owned the hurricane landing & fish camp ( what is now perkins landing ). We were left without power after the hurricane so all our food was on ice. It was about 11:00 pm and my dad asked me to walk to my grandparents store and get some ice, so I grabbed a flashlight and took off walking, it was less than a quarter of a mile from our house to the store and I was very used to walking the route on a daily bases. So I'm walking down the left side of the road and I can here the dogs barking and really cuttin up, they belonged to an older man who lived in a little white house down the road on the right. He kept them in a pin behind his house so when I get in front of the house I shine my light across the street at and around the house, suddenly I see something very large run from behind the house on two legs. I followed it with my light as it ran toward the woods, and then it stopped and turned and looked at me. It's eyes glowed red in the dark, and all the sudden it runs straight at me, it was so fast, I mean it traveled about 30 or 40 yards in just a flash and then it stopped right at the edge of the road. I was scared frozen, I couldn't scream or run and we just stood there for what seemed like an eternity but in all actuality was probably just a second or two. Then suddenly it let out a load high pitched growling sound and then I screamed and it turned and ran and I ran all the way home. When I got home I was so upset I could hardly breath or talk, my parents finally calmed me down and I told them what happened but they didn't believe me. The next day my dad and my uncle went down there to look for tracks but they didn't find any. My uncle told me I probably saw a bear but even I know a bear can't run on two legs. The creature I saw was extremely large, I would have to say now that it was at least 7 feet tall very broad shoulders, covered from head to toe in dark brown to black hair, his mouth and large, square teeth kind of stuck out from the rest of the face and the eyes were sunk in.

He needed to go into work that Sunday morning briefly. The sighting happened as he was returning home. He was approximately 100 yards away when he first saw it. He was coming around the bend in the express way when it came into view. There were no other cars in front or behind him. He surmised it waited until there were no vehicles visible in either direction before it crossed the highway, but then he caught it by surprise when he rounded the curve. The figure was already on Rick's side of the express way, roughly in the middle of the road, when it came into view. He cannot say for sure that it was covered with fur, but it was all the same dark color, with no indication of clothes or shoes, etc. He strongly thinks it was not a human for various reasons, including the fact that a person would likely not be running across the express way in that area, and then continue running into the trees where there are no obvious trails, and be completely out of view within a few seconds. Rick has seen deer crossing the express way in recent weeks also. Cotton Creek passes underneath the express way just before the crossing point, so the figure was generally paralleling the path of the creek when it crossed. In Google Maps satellite images of the area you can see a large structure a few hundred yards further up the highway from the crossing spot. That is a brand new structure for ""Toy Box Storage"". It is so new that it does not appear on the aerial images in Google Earth. In fact it is still under construction, so the Google Maps (as opposed to Google Earth) images are very recent.

But, as I get older, I feel this incident needs to be documented.The incident occurred in the winter of 1980 a few miles east of Clayton, Alabama in Barbour County. I was traveling with my Aunt, Grandmother and four younger cousins to a relative’s house. It was dark and probably around 9pm from the best I can remember. For some reason, my Aunt needed to turn around and proceeded to pull off the roadway by a small clearing. I was in the front seat of the car with my Aunt, who was driving, and my Grandmother. As we turned off the road, the headlights caught a figure in mid-stride. It then immediately froze and did not move anymore. It was about 30 yards from the car – very close. I could see the entire side view of this creature and its body was slightly turned so that it was looking at us. The most terrifying thing in my memory is this things huge eyes glaring at us. The best way I can describe the creature’s expression is “stunned.” The face was covered in hair except for around the eyes. The hair was dark and appeared longer and wavy looking on the arms and legs. It was very tall and massive yet lean looking. I would say it was easily over 7 feet tall, if not more. When it “froze” in the headlights, one arm was slightly extended behind the creature and it held this position. At this point, my Grandmother was crying and begging my Aunt to drive away. Two of my younger cousins were huddled on the floorboard in the backseat crying. I was terrified but could not look away. My Aunt kept telling my Grandmother “there is no way he can get in this car” and she kept the car still and we watched this motionless creature for about two to three minutes. It was almost completely motionless. It was as if the creature thought we could not see him if he did not move. I don’t know how it stood so still. The hair on my neck is standing on end as I type this. It scared me terribly. He kept staring at us with his eyes stretched very wide. I’ll never forget that “look” he gave us. Finally, my Aunt decided to flash the lights on and off real quick. The instant she did this, the creature jumped towards the woods and was gone. He was about 10 yards from the woods but made it there in less than a second. I can’t believe how fast this huge creature could move. This event traumatized me. I have never been able to go in the woods alone or enjoy camping since this event. I tried to deer hunt but could not enjoy it and quit – I can’t sit alone in a tree-stand without thinking of this creature and becoming tense. I can’t imagine coming upon this thing alone in the wilderness. I know these creatures exist. There is no doubt in my mind. I saw one up close and personal.

I piped up and told them that in was not a good idea. the trees cause a tunnel affect over the river. the helo wouldn't be able to see under the growth. on top of that the sun was starting to go down. he agreed and sent 6 men in 2 canoes down the river. 30-45 minutes passed and we were told that they had been found at a local bar in b'ham. my friend and I volunteered to pull the rescuers out of the river at a mid point near the road. we set off. the light was almost gone. as we made our way down the trail to a place where the stream and the cahaba meet my friend took off ahead of me. he knew the area better and i could see his light moving ahead of me. as I entered the bottoms where a bamboo thicket grew, I heard brush breaking and grunting noises to my left. I quickley made my way across the stream. I felt much better and safer once I crossed the stream. as I rejoined my friend at the intersection of the stream and river, I told him about what I had heard. he said it was probably a boar rooting for acorns. we sat for about an hour waiting. the moon was out quarter waxing, and hot as hell 100% humidity 90 degrees. after waiting I said to my friend that we must have missed the rescue team in the night. so he went to find out and he left me there on the bank to make sure they were not just slow getting down the river. another 30 minutes went by and I started seeing a light up the bank approaching my position.

He was driving home on the road that crosses the bridge, this area is located in a triangle between Blountsville, Hanceville & Holly Pond. He saw a large black or brown hairy figure stepping out of the woods as he was coming around a curve. He was startled and almost wrecked his car. His story later appeared in the Cullman Times, a paper in Cullman, Alabama. He later told me that he never was more affraid in his life. He looked it right in the eye and it stepped back in the woods. The location he saw it at is about a mile from my childhood home.

It finally turned and look at the witness for approx.. 20+ seconds before taking 2 long strides out of sight. The witness stated she was so awe struck she could not speak , even to tell her child to raise up and look. I asked about how tall it was and what she used to estimate its height. The witness told me her brother is 6' 6"" tall and her father is 6' 8"" tall, she stated she knows tall when she sees it.. and the sasquatch was possibly one foot taller than her father. It had broad shoulders, at least 3, closer to 4 feet wide. Its arms hung down to mid thigh level, it had very dark, closer to black, hair. Its head size was proportionate to the body size with the hair hanging down on the shoulders. The witness went home, got her husband and returned to the sighting area. She stated her husband knew something had definitely, really upset her. They found the area where it ran into the woods, large patches of grass had been pushed down in a stepping manner. I just talked to the witness again and she confirmed it was a bright clear day",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=45464

TB arrived at this spot about 2:30 in the afternoon. He placed his stand high in the tree about 100 yds. from the deer crossing. His stand is roughly 60 yds. from the creek at its closest point. As the sun begins to fade around 4- deer come to the brush and tree line to feed. TB heard something moving through the brush at 4:30, TB notices the lack of deer movement. This is the time of day the deer should be coming out. As it approached, crossing the last few rays of sunlight, TB could see something too dark to be a deer. Stepping into his shooting corridor was a 6-7 foot tall beast with brown hair and red tint. The creature was of slender build, with heavily defined upper leg and calf muscles. The creature appeared to be female as breasts swung with each stride. The face was covered in hair, small ears and very large eyes; it walked purposely with a relaxed stride swinging the arms. The arms hung down around ¼ the length of the legs. Being high in the tree stand with camouflage and upwind the female didn’t seem to notice TB at all.

The woods went right up to the road, there was very little shoulder.

Then I heard the sound of something coming up on the front porch so I sat up to look out the front window, it just so happens that we left the porch light on and what I saw was unforgettable and unbelievable. It was squatting down right in front of me I guess it was too big to stand straight up on the porch.

The witness had been at a family reunion, they had gathered all the trash and food scraps into trash bags on the front porch, (15’ x 15”x 9’). The trash consisted of ribs, chicken, burgers and drink cans, etc. Around 3:30 am on July 5, 2015 the witness was sleeping on the couch, right next to the porch. His cousin ""L"" was sleeping in the bedroom down the hall from the porch. The cousin heard it coming as she had seen and heard it before. Cousin ""L"" stated she just laid quietly in her bed, thinking ""I told him about this thing and he just laughed, so who’s laughing now"". She had heard it approach before and was waiting for the brothers reaction. The dog that yelped was a small dog at the back of the mobile home. Evidently it yelped when cousin ""L"" picked the dog up and put it in bed with her. (The dog being killed that was mentioned was a cousin's dog at a different location, not sure what could have killed it.) The witness stated that all the yipping little house dogs suddenly stopped their barking and went quiet. He then heard and felt the front porch groan. He sat up and cracked the blinds to see what was going on. He saw a Sasquatch come up to the porch, duck under the roof, sit down and start rummaging through the trash bags. They had left the porch light on, a 60 watt bulb, so very good visibility. As he watched this creature digging though the bags, it didn’t even get up to reach other bags. The arms were thought to be 4 - 5 ft. long, the fingers were described like Snicker bars with finger nails, and the head was shaped like the back of Darth Vader’s helmet. The hair was about 4 – 5 inches long, the hair was colored dark brown with a hint of red. The entire back was very muscular, the feet were estimated to be at least 16 inches long, and very broad. After doing some measurements it would appear the Sasquatch was about 8 1/2 feet tall and maybe 800 lbs. It had a very bad smell like cheese gone bad. The Sasquatch never did turn to where the witness could see the face. The witness was too scared to move, he’s not sure how long the creature was there. He is sure it was at least 20 minutes. His cell phone was on a charger across the room. He didn’t want to move and scare it away. When it was done it just took a leap to the ground and strode off though the yard across a 30 foot road in two strides, down a ravine and was gone. During my visit I was shown what appears to be finger and hand prints on the trailer. The fingers start at the far left side of the trailer, with the fingers closed together, and as the Sasquatch walked toward the porch the fingers began to open until at the bedroom window it became a smudge of a hand print. The fingers and hand print were at least twice the size of mine. The hand print was smudged like it had been looking in the widow and was trying for a better grip. Photos of the prints on the trailer:There is a long history of sightings in the area. It’s a sparsely populated area with just a few homes that are usually close together. There were more stories, but those witnesses couldn’t make it the day I was there. Other stories from the family include a cousin being observed as he stood next to his truck on a rural road; a close encounter by two others cousins, after almost hitting one as it entered the road in front of their vehicle; and another incident involving a young family member being chased as she delivered plates of food to her grandparents who lived nearby. Regarding the wish to kill something, I explained that we have never received a report where a Bigfoot hurt anybody. That they all have their own personalities and more likely there isn't just one in the area. I suggested that they may not take lightly to one of theirs getting shot. The folks living there who had close encounters realized at how much they look like humans, and they really couldn't kill any of them. One of the children attempted to take a photo of a Sasquatch from 200 yards, here is the photo, unfortunately it is blurry and little detail is seen: There is no doubt in my mind this was a real encounter. I know the area and if I were a Sasquatch, that's where I would live.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=49238

The farm has about 300 acres of woods covering an area of deep hollows leading down to sloughs off of a river. In late summer and fall of '79 we had been having trouble with deer poachers and some cattle rustling on our farm, so I was spending a lot of time out at night and on my off days trying to catch them. Several times at night and a couple of times during the day I had heard strange screams back in the woods towards the river. The first time I heard them, I thought it might be a peacock or a screech owl, but it really didn't sound like either, and it seemed to be much louder and more prolonged. I really didn't think much of it until one night I was walking back to the house from the back of the farm at about 11:00pm. It was a clear night with a bright half moon shining and I could see quite well. I was skirting along the south edge of the woods about 1/2 mile due north of the house when suddenly I got a creeping feeling that I was being watched and/or was in danger. My skin started crawling and the hair on the back of my neck and hands stood up. At the same time my dog, a large doberman pinscher, started acting nervous and whining quietly and started looking back over his shoulder to our left towards the woodline. I eased the safety off on my rifle and increased my pace. Right at that instant, something screamed right in the edge of the woods less than 35 yards behind and to the left of us. The pitch and volume of the scream was incredible. I could feel my chest vibrating from the loudness of the scream. My dog and I both broke and ran to our right out into the pasture about 50 yards and I spun around and stopped with my rifle up to see if it was chasing us, but it wasn't. I stood there with my rifle up and whatever it was screamed at us five or six more times. Also I could hear movement in the dry leaves where the sound was coming from, that sounded like a large person pacing back and forth. I could also see the tops of some saplings and small trees sway and move as it bumped into them or pushed and pulled on them. The screams were longer lasting and a little lower pitched than what I had heard before. I also know for sure that they weren't bobcat screams. I became aware of the sound of our cattle running away towards the southwest. The woods got quiet but I knew it was standing there still watching me. But I never saw anything. I backed away for about 100yds and then broke into a jog back to the house, spinning around and stopping with my rifle up about every 50 yards or so to make sure it wasn't following me. A few nights later, I was up late about 1:30am and getting ready for bed. I came out of the bathroom into my bedroom and my dog was standing there staring towards the front of the house. He was completely stiff, with the hair standing up on his back and neck and he was growling very low and menacingly. It was the ONLY time I ever saw him do that and he was deadly serious. I got a glimpse of a shadow move across the corner of my front bedroom window moving towards the west side of the house. The moon was shining right on the west wall of the house. My dog turned towards the west and kept growling even more seriously. Then I saw a large, sort of human shaped shadow move across both windows on the west side of the house. The dog kept turning and growling and following the shadow. Whatever it was, had to have been about 10 feet tall to cast a shadow that far up on the windows. I was petrified with fear. I finally picked up my riot shotgun and chambered a round of buckshot. My dog, at this time, was staring towards the north window of the spare bedroom and was still stiff and but not growling quite as bad. I got up enough nerve to look out the bathroom window but saw nothing. My yard was surrounded by a 3 ft high, hog-wire fence with two strands of barbed wire on top of it and locked steel gates, so whatever it was, stepped over the fence to get into and out of my yard. The gates made a lot of noise if you tried to climb or open them, so it didn't come or go through the gates.",1,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,window peaking,NA,NA,NA,screams,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,screams sounded like peacock,1,"The witness seems to be very credible.

At the time he was 18 years old and was with his cousin deer hunting on some property near his home. A tremendous ice storm had previously passed through the area, and left large tree branches on the ground. They heard a loud “pop” like an aluminum bat being hit on one of the trees or branches. They also heard footsteps, and this caused the men to turn to look behind them. A large creature stepped out from the tree line about 35 yds away. It did not move after noticing them, and just stared with squinting eyes “like someone does with poor vision after taking their glasses off.” It was described as having a large “melon shaped head”, with somewhat long, light brown hair with red highlights. The body was covered with similar hair. No nose or mouth was noticed. It stood on two legs, very long but proportionate for the body which was very massive and upright, standing about 9 feet tall. Musculature was not very noticeable due to the great amount of hair covering its body. Its feet were not noticed, being hidden by ground foliage. It made no further noise or movement toward the men. He distinctly remembers a smell associated with the sighting to be similar to rotten eggs and earthy, as well as smelling like the creature hadn’t bathed ever. He distinctly remembers being extremely frightened. He and his cousin then ran away from the creature as fast as they could. The creature did not follow. After thinking more about the visual sighting, he feels it was probably closer to 30 seconds. This witness was quite relieved to be able to tell his story after so many years. Over the past 11 years, he has talked to numerous other individuals in the area who have also had similar stories to tell like his. This witness also related an event that happened at age 21. He was at this same area camping with his cousin and had just cooked some hamburgers. His pet German Sheppard, who normally is quite aggressive and ferocious, began barking and growling at something in the nearby woods for at least 20 minutes. The dog then ran into the woods about 20 yards, and was then seen flying back out of the woods with a backward somersault, whining tremendously. The dog ran past the men out of the camp, still whining the whole time. They later found the dog back home. The cousin stated he saw something large and brown, but no other description was given.

Witness information withheld. The following is the witness’ account as related to Investigator Tim Cullen: At approximately 1:30 a.m. on a night in February 2000, the witness and a friend were planning to visit a girl who lived close to the sighting location. They were riding together on a motorcycle and knew they would not be able to ride up to the girl’s house without alerting her mother to their presence. They decided to hide the bike on the side of a dirt road and walk to the house from there. Very shortly thereafter, they began to hear what the witness described as very heavy walking/stomping noises. The witness described these sounds as similar to: 1. an extremely large person walking or 2. like a horse galloping only on two legs, coming from a swampy area which was northeast of their location. They squatted in the bushes and listened for a couple of minutes, at which time they determined the noise was getting closer to them and increasing in pace. At this time they decided to make a break for the motorcycle and vacate the area. The friend of the witness was in the lead and caused a branch to swing back hitting the witness in the head, knocking him down and “damn near knocking him out.” He got back up and began running after his friend all the while hearing the sounds of stomping and the crashing of underbrush getting closer to them. When he reached the spot where the motorcycle had been stashed, his friend was already pushing it out towards the road. He commented that at this time he could also hear heavy breathing which seemed to coincide with each footfall. Once they had the bike on the road, they both jumped on and his friend managed to kick start it and take off. The witness stated that he looked back just in time to see a very large creature leap from the edge of the woods out into the road. (I later measured this distance and it was a 12’ to 15’ jump, more or less.) He said it hit the road on all fours and then stood fully erect. He did comment that when the creature landed on the road, it let out an audible grunt he could hear even above the noise of the motorcycle. He said the moon was full or near full, and it was already in the western sky causing the creature to “stand in its own shadow.” Since the creature was silhouetted, he was unable to make out any detail such as facial features. However, he was emphatic that what he saw was not a bear as he’s seen bears before and they are much #8220;narrower” than what he saw (He emphasized this by hunching his arms forward and dropping his shoulders to indicate how a bear would stand and then standing fully erect with his arms out from his sides in the stance that he said he observed the creature to be in.). He said this creature was very wide and had “fluffy” hair which covered it entirely. He was unable to see any fingers on the hands although he did state that from what he could tell the hands appeared to be clenched and that the arms were longer than a human’s. He also said that from what he could see the creature appeared to be a dark brown or black color. When asked about the height of the animal, he said it was at least six to seven feet tall.

Before that I had found large footprints near the river and didn't think much of it. Once I saw the creature, I knew it had made the prints I saw a few months earlier. This report was first brought to our attention after BFRO Investigator Vince Lauria gave a lecture at a country club in Alabama. A Birmingham attorney volunteered the information that a caretaker on his land had seen a bigfoot several years ago. The attorney claimed that he had never really believed bigfoot existed until his caretaker had stated that he had seen one. The attorney commented that the man has worked for him for several decades and that he was incredibly honest. “He never lied to me before, so I can’t imagine him lying about something like that.” With the exchange of names and information we were able to contact the witness and hear his story. In August of 2004 the witness was driving north on private land along the Sepulga River. It was dusk, he had been plowing fields. As he turned a bend he saw a 6-7 ft black, hairy creature cross the road from right to left. The witness said it was less than 20 feet in front of him running quickly. It looked at him, kept eye contact but never slowed down or stopped. The witness had his window down and could hear it running through the thick woods after he lost sight of it. The witness described that it had a manlike face, with very long arms. The hair was black and shaggy, and he could see the hair hanging from its hands. It was not thin, but muscular. Dark skin was visible on the face, it had a wide nose, and a conical head. When it ran, it pumped its arms. It came from the direction of the river, and appeared to be wet. The witness said he had found footprints by the river earlier in the summer and didn’t know what had made them. Once he saw the bigfoot, he then realized that it had been responsible for the prints. He has not seen or heard of one before or since that summer. He told his boss and family only. The witness, his family, Investigator Vince Lauria and I went to the location of the road crossing. It is heavily wooded, bordered by the river and farm land. It is very secluded. There is a power line road that borders the property as well. Vince recalls interviewing a Native American brother and sister that saw a bigfoot on the other side of the river less than a mile away.

He stated he had told a friend of mine about his experience, and the friend gave him my telephone number and suggested he contact me. The friend is a law enforcement officer in a county that adjoins Cullman County. The LEO has seen one of the animals similar to the one described by this witness. He, his father and brother have been aggressively intimidated by similar animals on their hunting land. A few years ago he took an exceptionally good photograph of a large, man-like track left by an enigmatic primate on the property of a family member. I have had the pleasure of working closely with the friend in investigating his and other residents’ reports from that area of Alabama. I spoke with the witness several times after his first call. As a result of those conversations a few more details can be added to his original report. • The first sounds that he heard before the figure came into view were yipping and barking which he thought were made by coyotes. • Those sounds were immediately followed by whooping, a loud yelling sound and loud bipedal footsteps. • He then saw a large, dark hair-covered figure “walking hard” out of a draw to his left. • The figure was walking at an angle past him about seventy yards away when it turned left into thick brush to walk directly up slope toward the top of what is locally called Wilhite Mountain. • The witness stated the animal was in view for about two minutes. • He could hear the sounds of the animal’s travel up the mountain for a minute or so. • The animal was “dark” colored, about eight feet tall, taking long strides while leaning forward and with only moderate movement of its arms. • The animal’s upper body was very wide and thick, with little tapering to the waist line, and the head appeared large. • Facial features were not noted. The witness is believed to be a credible observer and his encounter report valid. Residents of Cullman and Morgan Counties have generated many reports of enigmatic primates during the past several years.

Her accounts were consistent and believable. Here is a sketch made by the witness: The following can be added to this report - The hair was six to eight inches long The hair was dark brown. There were leaves stuck in the hair on the buttocks. The head was very bulky. The huge size of the hands was the most remarkable visual noted by the witness. The right hand held what looked like a rock. The rock was egg shaped and almost as large in diameter as a bowling ball. The creature handled the rock as if it were a softball. The creature’s movement was powerful. The estimated height was 7’ 6”. The estimated weight was 450+ pounds. This sighting was at sunset. The witness hit her brakes and horn when she saw the deer sprint full speed across the road. She had never seen a deer run that fast. As the car was stopping, she saw the creature coming to a stop near the roads edge. The headlights started to light up the creature as it turned to its left and walked back into the pine forest. She slowly drove forward until she was at the point where the creature entered the forest. Her window was down and she could smell a very strong, musty odor with the power of skunk. She could also hear the creature making deep, raspy, loud grunts. When she looked for the source of the grunts she could see the creature about 50 feet inside the wood line facing her car. These grunt unnerved the witness and she drove home. I met with the witness the afternoon after the encounter where the sighting took place. The pine forest was thick with trees from 3” to 12” in diameter. The ground was covered with a thick layer of pine needles so no tracks could be found. I did find deep scuff marks near the roads edge where she said the deer sprinted across the road. We stayed road side for about an hour as it started getting dark. There was a huge storm front moving in and lightning could be seen flashing on the horizon. I decided to make two quick whoops to see if there would be any response. Two seconds later there was a faint response that we both heard. The response was of the same cadence and tone I had used. We stayed there in the dark for about 20 minutes then left because the storms were getting close The witness went back to the site alone 2 days later. She started to smell the same odor again after about 10 minutes. The odor started getting stronger after another 2 minutes so she left and did not go back.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=45296

As military firefighters we would often be assigned to small airfields (stagefields) around Ft Rucker. At the time this happened I was assigned to Tabernacle stagefield. Tabernacle was on the north west end of a large impact area used for aerial gunnery by pilots in training. During a typical duty day we would have several down time periods where aircraft were not flying. These down time periods would typically take place around noon and evening lasting 2.5 to 3 hours. When I was assigned to Ft Rucker, I had met some other Soldiers that introduced me to Indian “relic” hunting. This consisted mostly of lots of walking through tilled fields, creek washouts, and recently cleared timber tracts looking for arrowheads and anything else related to the old Indian tribes that formally lived in the south east Alabama region. I had found that the down times when aircraft were not flying often granted me the chance to get out in the woods to hunt for arrowheads. Often I was able to get several miles away from the stage field during the down times and was usually by myself for several hours. My typical hiking outfit was to put on a pair of cargo shorts, an old pair of army boots, a belt with a canteen, a pouch (for any finds), a large survival knife, ball cap and a walking stick. I usually would not wear a shirt hoping to get a tan while out walking. This day in particular was in I left my stage field around 1100 AM or so. I headed East, North East for about 1.5 miles on an improved asphalt road that bordered the impact area. I then head north down a dirt road (path was more like it) that was seldom traveled. The road went up and down some gentle hills and was bordered on both sides by heavy vegetation and thick woods. I believe I had walked maybe ¾ of a mile when I was approaching a small creek crossing which was not unusual. I was maybe within 50 feet of the creek when off to my left side I heard a lot of movement approximately 150-200 feet into the woods appearing to come from the creek bank. I heard what I can only describe as a grunt and my first though was a wild pig. That thought was quickly erased though, as I immediately got instant chills…goosebumps running my entire body…and had the heavy feeling that I was not alone. I heard another grunt and peered into the woods from where the sound came from and saw a large “shadow”…easily 6 to 7 foot tall stand from the creek bed. Because of the thick woods I got no clear view of it but my first thought was that it was a large very dirty man but it definitely had the appearance of a man shape. I only saw this thing for a few seconds as it appeared to see me…and me watching it and it turned and went crashing into the woods away from me. I wasted no time turning my walk into a trot away from what I had just seen. Whatever it was it scared me and as I headed back to my airfield I tried to make sense of it. The only thing I could conceive it being was that maybe it might have been a stray horse back in the woods. I know this sounds very unlikely but I really didn’t want to believe I might have seen something I could not explain…a horse in the woods I could almost believe. I never went back into that area of the woods again, and seldom ventured into thick woods period after that. I never gave it much thought after that as I had chalked it up as being a horse, which seemed to make sense to me. I did bring my strange experience up a couple of times to some folks but they thought I was kidding them and none of them had ever heard of anything like that in Alabama before. Two things led me to revise my thinking of what I saw that day. The first being this. In 2000…I was and am still living in Kansas and serving in the Army Reserve. We had a new Soldier join my unit. He was a former Ranger Sniper team leader having been assigned to the Ranger battalion at Ft Lewis, WA. He was a good old country boy from Kansas living in a small town. He and I became very good friends and later served in Iraq together. We would often talk about events in our lives at length. During one conversation I related my story about what I saw in the woods assuming he would think I was nuts. But…he believed me. As a matter of fact he said if I saw something I found hard to believe he said that I should just go with what my gut told me. He then informed me about his experiences. He told me about his time up at Ft Lewis and as a sniper he would often be in the woods alone for days at a time in hide sites during training missions. He told me that at night in the deep woods he would often feel as if he was being watched and would hear the sounds of something large moving through the woods. Now this fellow was an experienced woodsman and was used to the sounds and smells of the woods. On occasion he was able to see something quite large in the shape of a man moving around his hide site through his night vision goggle. He said it would never come too close…just kind of checking him out. He said he never felt threatened by it and on the occasion it would make some sounds (grunts or whistles) as if it was agitated and he would talk calmly too it. He said that he wood talk in a slow, low voice telling it “I’m not here to hurt you, just calm down, I don’t mean no trouble for you”. He said that usually after he spoke towards it, it would just move away from him and would leave him alone. He said this happened numerous times as he was often in the same area. He told me he had no doubts at all that “Bigfoot” was around but he would never do anything to harm it and he felt that if left alone it would not harm anyone. So that got me to thinking, maybe that afternoon in the woods I really did see a Bigfoot. The second reason I feel that I didn’t see what I convinced myself was a horse is that after culling the BFRO website I found that I am not the only one to have seen something in Alabama. So…I am not alone and I am now convinced that what I saw was real…and not something else. I haven’t shared this story with very many people…but maybe this is the time to do it",1,6.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,dark,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,moving from river to the woods,NA,NA,bipedal,grunting,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"The witness is a 37 year old male.

My son, daughter-in-law, wife and I had been over at my in-laws having dinner. My son and his wife and their infant son had recently moved in with us. We were in the process of adding a new laundry room and garage on the back side of our house. When we came in from next door my son and his family were ahead of my wife and me by a minute or two. I noticed the lights to the new addition were on and figured that one of them had gone out to retrieve their laundry. I opened the back door and said is anyone out there. I didn’t yell so I thought they might not have heard me. I stepped out on the patio and started walking toward the garage that didn’t have a door hung yet. As I did I saw a dark figure at the back of our SUV. It scared me that there was “someone” in, or had just passed through our garage. Without saying another word I ran back into the house to get my 410 shotgun and let me son know to join me outside. This only took 30 seconds or less. I went back out but this time I was yelling “if there is someone out there you better speak up or I am going to shoot you.” My son joined me and we ran out into the yard both yelling for the person to identify themselves. We circled our house and saw nothing. It had rained earlier in the afternoon and evening and as we came back to re-enter our house confident that what I had seen ran away we noticed footprints on the concrete patio deck. These footprints at first looked like that of foot gloves people that fit each toe like a glove does the hand. But the thing that was conspicuous was the size. They were enormous. Not only long but wide, huge like that of what an NBA star might leave. (I say that because I have a pair of shoes owned by an NBA star that my nephew gave me who is on an NBA coaching staff.) My point, these were very large feet and very wide strides. It then dawned on me how large the figure I saw in the garage had to be. As stated I own an SUV and at the back part of the garage where I saw the figure the concrete starts to slope down from the garage. This figure I saw was head and shoulders over the top of the SUV and he (it) was already on the slope because he was not inside the garage when I saw him. I joked to my son and later to my family; you know that thing I saw that night was big enough to be a Sasquatch. We all laughed because we had not heard of any other Bigfoot sightings in lower Alabama. Then your show comes to television and I go on your site today and learn that there was indeed a Bigfoot sighting on Ft. Rucker back in the 90’s by a solder. I live just five to six miles from the post. I’m not convinced that what I saw should be reported to you but I do know that if it was a person I never want to see them again on a dark night in my yard because they are a very big person.

The SUV was parked in the garage with the rear of the vehicle at the entrance of the garage. The witness saw the back upper torso, shoulders, and head of the creature. This entire time of observation was five seconds from a distance of approximately twenty five feet. There was no description of arms, lower torso, and legs as they were blocked from view by the vehicle. During this encounter there was a light on in the garage that allowed the witness to notice this detail. However, no face detail was noted, other than the absence of visible ears, because the animal was observed from behind. The witness estimates the height of his SUV at around six foot six inches. The creature in question would have been over a foot taller than the top of the SUV according to witness observation, placing the animal at around eight foot tall. As stated, after about five seconds of observation the witness ran inside. After returning outside with his son the witness noticed three footprints left on his concrete drive due to the animal walking onto the driveway from the wet grass caused by the evening rain. He describes them as looking like a man’s footprint. The witness is fortunate enough to own a shoe once worn by an NBA player. The shoe in question is a size sixteen and the witness states the wet footprint wouldn’t fit into the shoe. He said the width of the print stood out as being wider than the foot that would have been in the size sixteen shoes. He also estimates the distance between the footprints at around four feet with the total distance covered in three steps at just over twelve feet. The area around the witness’ property is wooded with intermittent farms and fields. The animal would have had to cover an area of around seventy-five yards in order to reach the wood line from where the witness observed the creature. According to the witness he was in the house about thirty seconds. I found this witness to be articulate and forthcoming and believe he is credible. In my opinion there is land nearby that would support such animals and there is an abundance of game in the area. The land I reference is Ft.

Firstly concerning the trail. He said it was a kind of path that connected a neighborhood with a local grocery store. This trail was bordered by woods all around which could provide plenty of cover for a large bipedal creature to come and go without detection. Also, very near the trail where the encounter occurred is the grocery store dumpster, containing thrown out food. This very well could be the reason this creature was encountered at this location. Now concerning the encounter. The witness said he remembered falling off his bike, looking up and seeing this large, brown hairy creature. He estimated that it was ten feet from him, looking directly at him when it let out a loud howl/growl that terrified him. I asked him about facial and bodily features, other than what he stated in his report. He distinctly remembered the mouth being wide open as it howled/growled, displaying human-like teeth, only larger. The howl/growl was deep yet pitched, and lasted a few seconds. He said it sounded like nothing he has ever heard. Immediately after this it turned and walked off the trail into the woods at a high rate of speed. As it moved through the woods, the witness remembers hearing branches snapping. The witness then got up, climbed on his bike and rode home as fast as he could, where he hid in his house, fearfully peeking out the window hoping the creature did not follow him home. The witness seemed very credible to me. He was clear about the details he remembered and did not try to embellish or add to it. To this day the witness has not returned to the site of the encounter.

The son carried one board in and the witness grabbed a second board, as he did he looked out over the backyard. The outside light cast a shadow over the trees in the backyard. As he looked around he noticed a raunchy smell like something dead. Then he noticed that he had one too many trees in the yard. The “tree” took a step and a half crossing the 10 ft. wide path of light. The creature was 8ft tall, about 500lbs, graying hair like you get as you get older with patches of dark brown. The creature was very muscular with knee length arms. The witness, a fifteen-year marine veteran, stated that he had seen a lot of things, but not once did he think of grabbing a gun and going to look for tracks. He knew what he saw. Two nights later his brother who is a pastor saw the same creature cross between his truck and a car in front of him in his headlights. Two nights after that the witness and his 27 year-old son were leaning against the tail gate of the pickup, as they looked across the yard. The son said ""there’s a little one at the edge of the woods"". As they watched the “little one” stood up to be the 8ft adult that was seen four nights before. Shortly after that, a few days later, the nieces came running in screaming, saying something was after them and had been throwing rocks at them. The witness and his brother grabbed two rifles a 30-06 and an AR-15. They stood on the pool deck looking around to see what was going on. The longer they stood the more the cool night air took its toll. The witness started inside only to hear his brother a pastor of many years exclaim s**t. The brother stated that when he moved to go in, the creature also moved from behind the tree it had been watching from. The brother was wide-eyed with disbelief as he was told ""welcome to the club"". Since that first night the witness posted on Facebook for the world to see, not caring what people thought because he KNEW. He received a call from his neighbor. That same night as the witness saw the creature; she couldn’t sleep and had gone out to her deck. While on the deck she observed what was apparently the same creature eating pears from her tree. Since then he has had many people step forward with their own sightings. The witness has had 6in diameter trees torn apart, rocks, dirt and other objects thrown in their direction.

Its pretty open where it walked out so I got an okay look at it, but it was still a couple hundred yards out. Things that caught my attention were the way it seemed to walk. It had short legs and a longer upper body. Its head stuck up away from the shoulders. The arms hung beside it and hands were nearly touching the knees. It was all black. At first sight I was just like, that's a man, but the closer I got the more I realize how different it looked. How much bigger it appeared. Plus it came from the woods, walked across the road into a swampy area. With no cars or anyone around. It just seemed out of place to me. That's what made me focus on more detail. You could tell it didn't have clothes on because it was just one slick figure. Not baggy from jackets/ pants/ etc. Not to mention it was rainy and around 30 degrees that morning. Whatever it was, I had never seen and I hunt all the time in the woods. But I will say it was defiantly not a bear or any human I've ever seen before.

The creek where the sighting took place is actually a long, narrow, winding man-made lake about 200 yards wide. He had been fishing in the dark for about 15 minutes when the fighting sounds started. For about 30 minutes, the two animals were running left and right about 60 yards each way as they worked their way down hill towards the witness. The sound of tree limbs being ran through and broken was accompanied with growling and hollering. The two would stop frequently and to the witness it sounded as if they were fighting each other. Being a mature, lifelong outdoorsman, he could tell there was no way it could be deer or humans fighting. When he could tell they were in a clearing near the waterline across from his location, he illuminated them with a powerful spot light. The light illuminated the left side of two 7’-7.5"" tall bipeds facing the same direction (90 degrees to the witness). They had dark skin. Their shoulders were very wide and both had large buttocks and hands. They were very lean and muscles could be seen in action.

He describes the creature as squatting down in a grassy area immediately adjacent to the road with its knees close to its armpits. The head was down, and both arms were extended forward searching through the grass with hands as if looking for something. It was not digging. The hair was black, with no highlights. His first impression was that it was a young person in a costume on the side of the road, but he ruled this out quickly since the skin and hair fit tightly to the body. The creature did not turn to look at them, but rather kept searching through the grass. The face was not seen. The witness estimated it was the size of an average human male and maybe up to 225 pounds. After seeing the creature he asked his friend if he had seen it, and his friend acknowledged he had.

January 5, 2000, three friends and I decided to camp on one of my friend's land. We had two fourwheelers and a dog with us. It was a rainy day and the ground of surrounding area was significantly wet. We decided to camp anyway. It stopped raining about dusk when my friend and I started to pitch the tent, while the other two went back to there house for some more supplies. Mind you we were only camping about a mile from the road and one and a half miles from the landowner's home. About ten minutes after their departure me and my friend started hearing strange grunts, foul smell, and heavy footsteps. It went on for about ten minutes, with sounds getting closer and at random, as though the ""animal"" was trying to scare us or get us to make a move. It stopped when my friends arrived back and we dismissed as deer, spooked by our presence. We told of the incident to our friends and the landowner's son explained that his dad had been experiencing ""strange"" occurences lately. We went on with our camping and rode four-wheelers for about two hours. When we arrived back at camp, we decided to stay for the rest of the night. About ten minutes after arriving back, the same strange grunts and heavy steps began again. This time they were more aggitated and frequent. The sounds came within at least twenty yards of our camp. The area is heavily wooded so I could not see the animal at this time. The animal was across the creek at the beginning of the sounds and eventually jumped down into the creek, about a seven foot drop, and stayed there making grunts and heavy steps there for about five to ten minutes. Being very frightened and defensive, I picked up about a ten pound rock and threw it in the vicinity of the animal below in the creek. I could not see the animal due to the foliage. It must have hit the animal because it gave a loud shriek and ran up the creek away from us, then jumping back up on the bank, a seven foot jump, and running back behind our campsite. It then proceeded to make very loud grunts and ran around the back of the campsite about twenty yards away in the woods out or our fire's sight. It then stopped and we could hear it breathing heavily. Talking amongst ourselves and shouting at the animal, it then made the most blood-curdling scream I have ever heard. I would describe it as high-pitched and seemed to echo everywhere around us. I have heard bobcats and screech owls and can tell you this was not one. We then proceeded to leave hasitly on our ATVs and went and got the father of my friend. He came back with us and stayed awhile with no occurences. He left and we somehow got ourselves to stay for the night. Nothing happened the rest of the night and we went to sleep. I awoke at 3am to the same grunts and heavy footsteps. This time they were very close. They lasted by my watch til 345am. Not awaking my friends in fear of the animal becoming aggressive, I laid there and listened to this animal. Afterwards, I laid there until sunrise and told my friends of the sounds and occurences of the night. They asked me due to my, as they described, pale face and rattled demeanor. We then went and looked for any evidence of the animal. We found locks of hair in the trees, approx. seven foot high, and numerous large footprints, similar to a humans, but with no arch and a very large great toe. We then proceeded to follow the footprints to where, amonst downed trees and foliage, we found where a large animal had been laying. We found hair there also. We continued to trail the animal's leavings when came across the same sounds of footsteps. They were too scared to go over the hill and see the animal making the noise so they told me to. Reluctantly I did, and saw a large upright creature, approx. seven to eight feet tall, walking with its back to me. It was covered in hair, black to dark brown, and had an awful smell. It turned and alarmed by my presence ran away from me. I then turned and ran away from it towards my friends who I shouted to to run. They got up and ran and we ran back to our campsite and stayed there where I told them what I saw. For a few months after that we heard the same grunts and shrieks down the creek where we camped that night. We frequently rode ATVs down there and an occurence was frequent. Occurences also happened at other places, two to three miles away from the area of occurence. A sighting was also reported at a park about a mile up the road from my house, three miles from the creek. We also found footprints in nearby rock quarry. My brother and I also saw a ""brown"" animal, who we thought to be a man at first, but, trailed him to find that could not have been a man, on hunting land a mile from our house.

The witnesses described how they were camping on land belonging to one of the families. They had never experienced anything remotely close to what they experienced that night. While two of the witnesses left the area, two of the four stayed behind and began working on erecting a tent. It was then that they first began hearing strange sounds and began smelling a rancid odor (which persisted through much of the night). Keep in mind that these young men all grew up in the vicinity and were well used to all the sounds of the forest. These sounds were uniquely peculiar in that they sounded almost human-like. The witnesses “heard something like a person” 20 – 30 yards away just after the sun had gone down. What they were hearing was similar to the sounds of ""someone walking around."" It was now “pitch dark.” A campfire was burning and flashlights and ATV lights were in use. The sounds began to evoke images of someone “stomping around or jumping.” The two young men now found themselves getting “spooked.” Whatever it was, it remained just out of sight and across the creek. Then, the two began hearing “deep growls.” The young men's dog, a cocker spaniel, was decidedly uncomfortable with the disquieting visitor. The witnesses remarked that the dog was extremely nervous, whiney and afraid through out the evening. When the other two witnesses arrived back on the scene, the sounds seemingly stopped. A while later, the sounds (“stomping, jumping, and growling”) resumed, this time all four of the young men heard them. The sounds continued for approximately 15 minutes, then the unseen entity sounded as though it jumped into the creek and began approaching the young men. At that time, the witnesses, already scared, now became defensive and began shouting (still thinking – indeed hoping it to be human) at the intruder, ordering it to not come any closer. The primary witness indicated that at that time he picked up a large rock and threw it toward the unknown and unseen harasser. The stone must have hit its target or came very close, because the unidentified tormentor shrieked and hysterically ran around the campsite, the whole time the young men hearing its loud panting and breathing. Once it stopped, the witnesses decided to end the stand off and defiantly began to approach the creature. The animal then produced a scream that “sounded like a woman but much more high-pitched.” The primary witness stated that the scream was so loud that it actually made his “ears hurt.” The witnesses immediately left to retrieve one of their fathers. When the witnesses returned, all activity had ceased. The father witnessed nothing of the sort that the young men had witnessed and casually dismissed the incident. The young men were still not sure of what they had encountered. The father managed to calm the young men down, and they reluctantly decided to stay the rest of the night at the campsite. I asked the witnesses why they would choose to return and stay there after having endured such a harrowing experience. The said they all lived there and knew the woods well, and that the animal could have been anything, and they believed that the game of torment was over. Into the night, the primary witness awoke to more noises, but he chose to try to ignore the sounds. He remained awake until the sun came up. When the other young men awoke the next morning, they combed the area for indications of what had tormented them during the night. The witnesses found large humanlike footprints “15 – 16 inches in length with five toes,” and an area where something large had created a nest with a crude, rudimentary roof of tree branches. Also in the area around the nest, they found dark hairs. Apparently they began to hear noises again, and the primary witness “crept” up a small hill and peered over it, only to see a “large, hairy animal” with its back facing him. The animal was at a distance of 30 – 40 yards. It turned once and looked at the witness and then ran off. The witness described the creature as being “dark brown,” and “around seven feet tall,” with a face that “looked like a gorilla.” At that time, the witness thought to himself, “So this is what a bigfoot looks like.” The father came to the campsite and inspected the area. He listened to the testimony of the primary witness and looked at the tracks. He then told the young men that he believed they had been harassed by a bigfoot",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=7427

We got there just before dark and had been there for several hours when it happened. The place where we were is on a large power transmission line right of way.There is a small stream that crosses the clearing, and a very steep hill on the side where we parked. In fact, so steep that it is difficult to drive a four wheel drive down to the stream. On the other side of the stream there is a low level spot that then becomes another steep hill. I would say that the hills are a good 50 feet higher than the stream. I had parked my truck on the hilltop, and we sat on the tailgate facing the stream. Around 11:00 pm we heard a very loud snorting noise coming from the bottom of the hill, and the sound of brush moving and breaking. I thought that it was a wild hog, because they are plentiful in this area, so I told my wife to get in the truck, because I was afraid it would attack us. She got in the truck while I tried to find my flashlight and my gun. When she slammed the door, I heard a loud, low growl/grunt and it sounded like something large started running up the hill towards us. I was standing in the bed of my truck by now trying to shine my light down the hill, but the batteries were weak and I couldn't see very far.There was a very bright moon out so I turned off my light, and could see a large shadow moving around about halfway up the hill towards us. I was listening to it move around and make the same growl/grunt noise. I could also hear what sounded like breathing noises. I then caught scent of a strange, musky, sour odor and heard more brush breaking and what sounded like stomping noises. I was certain by now that this was not a wild hog, but couldn't figure out what it might be. So I told my wife to start my truck and rev the engine a few times and when she did, I heard what sounded like something crashing through the brush heading down hill and moving fast. We were both a little spooked by now so we left. As I pulled out onto the dirt road off the power line trail, I turned toward the bridge that crosses the small stream (the road roughly parallels the power line) a large number of deer ran at high speed across the road,heading away from the stream.

The witness returned to the sight 3 days later and found pine saplings had been pulled up including the roots and thrown up slope in the direction of where he had been parked. Due to rains, there were no prints noted. The witness remembered times when the dogs used to run deer would either refuse to get out of the truck or would cease to chase deer and return to the trucks and try to get back in their boxes. He also remembered hunting with two other members who had placed two deer carcasses in a creek to keep cool until later in the day. When they returned to retrieve the deer, one of the carcasses was gone. The water level was too low and slow to have floated the dead deer away.

I will say that I moved to Alabama 6 years ago, met and married my husband and he familiarized me with ""the ways of the wild""...ie sounds, smells, woods, etc. I learned as much about the outdoors as I could and visit them often to this day. The experience I am about to share occured in January 2007. My husband belonged to a hunting club and we spent most of our free time enjoying waterfalls and creeks....looking at stars...sitting and talking, absolutely everything slips away when you go into the wild. We decided not to go to the hunting club this night, but to an old abandoned grave yard. An elderly couple used to go there years ago and keep it clean from debris and weeds but since they died it is grown over. It seems to be such a peaceful place full of history and romance. We had been there often and this particular night my husband was, to say the least, enebriated, and we were just sitting in the car talking...the moon was very bright and the stars were all out. I kept hearing branches breaking, to my left, I was in the driver seat of the car and my husband was in the passenger seat. I thought it was probably a rabbit or another critter of the night...but I started to get a very creepy feeling...as if I was being watched...I felt this for a time before my husband asked me why I was looking to my left constantly. I simply said I feel like I am being watched and shrugged it off. The feeling did get stronger and I continued to look to my left into the surrounding woods to find out exactly what was giving me this eerie feeling. This went on for quite a while...I also noticed a foul odor but could not pin point it's source..I thought it was my husbands usual bout of, well to put it delicately, indigestion...I eventually saw a very tall figure and told my husband that someone was in the woods and he was standing between two tall pine trees...He thought I was crazy and laughed it off...I never stopped looking and saw this figure sway from side to side...from tree to tree..never approached...never made a sound. I looked for about 5 or 10 minutes before I was just too scared to stay there anymore, so we left. A similar experience happened to my husband 5 years ago right after I moved here. It is currently posted on this site. I have been encouraged by Mr. M. Collins to post my experience..throughout this experience my husband never witnessed what I saw. He says he could not see anything out in the dark because of the glare of the dashboard lights (we had the radio on low). I am not sure what exactly I did see...I just know that I have frequented these woods for years and have never felt like that before...I do not intimidate easily and I was extremely ready to leave that night. I have gone back to the graveyard, but not nearly as often as before the incident. I am always on guard there.

While not a long time outdoors person, she has spent the last few years going into her husbands leased hunting preserve with him. She is no longer comfortable going into the woods or into this area even with her husband and myself. Though her husband was in the car, he was in the passenger seat and the angle and the glare on the windshield from the radio dial light prevented him from seeing what she was seeing. The witness is quite sure of what she observed. After marking the trees she indentified with tape, and using her husband as a reference (he is 5'11""), the witness feels sure that the creature that she saw observing them was 7 feet tall or at least a foot taller than her husband. Photos of the area and the trees where she observed the creature have been taken. The distance from where the witness was in her car to the trees she observed the creature is about 15 meters. While the brush looks thick from the road, the underbrush is quite thin and would allow a fairly large animal to move unobstructed within the tree line. The shape was that of a man but much more bulky and taller. The head appeared to set directly on the shoulders. The witness also recalled a smell similar to rotten eggs during the encounter. The only other item she recalled was the presence of what she thought was reflected moonlight from what appeared to be eyes. She compared the color to that of a dog with cataracts in appearance.

It occurred in the spring of 1978 or 79. I cannot seem to recall eactly since it has been many years ago. I'm in my early 30's now but, at the time of the sighting I was 13 or 14. I was on an annual family visit to my Grandparents place in Athens. We had gone out to ""the River"" for a few days. I can't recall what day it was but I do remember that is was in the early afternoon. I was a typical kid then so naturally I was doing kid stuff. I had a Frog gig and I was downat the boathouse pier throwing it into the shallow water trying to randomly hit something in the water. ( I did nail a Crappie but, I did not hurt it bad so I let it go). At the end of the slew was a swampy area. This area started approx. 175 to 250 yards from my Grandparents cabin. It was shallow water and several hardwood trees such as Oak or Dogwood, for example, growing within the swamp. The swamp went back perhaps a few miles. (No one in my family nor myself, except maybe my Grandfather, had ventured too far into that swamp). Along the sloping bank from the cabin to the swamp were 3 other cabins with piers. Across from the cabins is a gentle sloping pasture, next to it are a couple of cabins and boathouses. It seems that every time I was at the boathouse and I looked across the water there were always cows in the pasture. However, that day I just let the Crappy go and I happened to look out toward the swamp. As i did I noticed something emerge from the swamp, next to and below the pasture fence about 50 feet, and wade into the water of the slew. It was dark in color, black I think,( this I know because it was a sunny day), it stood upright. It had waded into the water ""knee"" deep. I did not really pay attention at first thinking it was a Bear. However, I looked again a few seconds later and soon realized it was not a bear. It was tall, approx. 8 or 9 feet, well built, and very hairy. I could not make out any facial features due to the distance, I did not notice a neck and the head was round shaped. The animal proceeded to look both ways, it then bent over at the waist and took its left arm and swung it into the water. I noticed the splash. The animal did this twice. It then stood up and looked straight in my direction. It stood there a few seconds then turned around and walked back into the swamp just like a person would. I stood there and just of shrugged my shoulders and went back to messing around. About 3 or 4 minutes later I looked back toward the swamp again and the creature came back out from the same spot that it had before. It waded ""knee"" deep into the water once again and did the exact same thing over that it had done before, including looking my direction once again. It then turned around and wandered back into the swamp in the same area it had come out of. It did not come back out again, for I stayed at the pier for about another hour and I keep looking that-a-way several times. To this day I am convinced that it was trying to catch fish. I never felt I was in any danger even though it was an odd experience. However, being at that age I did not want to go outside alone after dark for any reason including to use the bathroom. ( The cabin bathroom was in the basement and one had to get to it by going outside). It took me a few years too be comfortable there at night. In regards to that sighting there was something I noticed, there were no cattle to be seen in the pasture at the time of the sighting! The funny side to all this is that I had carried a pair of binoculars down to the pier with me and left them sitting next to me on the upper rail. Not once did it occur to me to pick them up and use them! A side note Two weeks earlier two boys had found large human like footprints in that region somewhere as reported in a local newspaper. About ten years ago my Grandmother sold the place. However, I was in Athens a couple of years ago so I drove out to ""the River"" too see the old place. No one was there so I took the liberty of walking downto the pier and boathouse. Except for a new paint job on the cabin and a refurbished boathouse nothing had changed over the years. The slew and swamp were still the same. I remained for an hour picking up fossils since the water was down, it being late summer. During that brief time I looked toward the swamp periodically remembering, wondering, and well, kind of hoping",1,8.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,black,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,round,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,"round head , no neck",NA,"knee deep in water then bent at waist and used left arm to swing in the water , left into the woods , came back and did the same thing",NA,NA,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=799

By the time we were finished feeding everything it was dark but I had decided to run a cord with a light on it out to the fence and work on it a while longer adding more clips to it . The local high school is about 1 or 1 1/2 miles from our house and they were having a tractor pull that night and I could hear the noise from the tractors .Other than that, it was quiet out . The fence is out close to the barn which has a security light on it . With that light and the light on the cord that I had hanging from one of the tall fence post, the area where I was working was well lit . I had been working for about 2 hours when I heard a noise coming from the woods to my left about 100 or 150 yards away . There is a deer trail that runs through the woods there and the noise I heard sounded like something had caught a deer . I continued putting clips on the fence, not thinking anything else about the noise I had heard and about 25 or 30 minutes later at about 100 yards up from the place I had heard the first noise, I heard something make a loud hollering howling sound . Not wanting to believe what I heard, I told myself that it had to have been the neighbors dog . They have a huge dog that has a hoarse bark . Anyway, I decided it was time for me to go inside . I gathered up my tools and just as I was about to get on the four wheeler, I heard it holler,howl again . This time the sound came from the area where I had heard the first noise, that sounded like the deer had been caught . I didn't take time to turn the four wheeler around . I backed it all the way back to the house, right up to the back door .I jumped off, ran in and locked the door .I was shaking so bad I could barely stand . It was like I was having a nightmare, I couldn't believe what I had heard . I told my husband and we went back out with the gun but we didn't hear anything . I knew what I had heard sounded like the sound the bigfoot made on the programs I had watched on TV and at first I even thought I was crazy for even thinking that that's what it could have been and Iv'e tried my best to convince myself there's no way it could have been a bigfoot but it hasn't worked . My husband keeps saying that he believes I had heard something and that there's a good explanation for it because there's no such thing as a bigfoot . He hasn't been able to give me a good one yet . I have called the local game warden and tried to mimic the sound I had heard asking him if he knew of any animal in this area that would make this sound and he said no . He did say that the only thing he could think of might be some sort of canine - a coyote or if it was more of a high pitched sound it might be a fox . Please believe me this was no coyote, no fox, no small animal could make a sound like the one I heard . It was 100 or 150 yards away and it sounded like it was standing right behind me . I could tell that it was coming from something very large because of the power behind the sound and the sound it's self was like a loud Ahoooooooo .There's no way anyone could have been in the woods faking this . It was real . This experience has affected me big time . My doors are closed and locked now day and night - I don't think a locked door would stop it, but I lock them anyway . If I'm at home alone during the day and I need to go outside for anything, I carry a gun with me . Under no circumstances do I go outside at night now . I'm afraid to sleep at night . I'm scared to death here now . I don't know for a fact that what I heard was a big foot but I believe with everything inside me that it was . When I found this sight on the internet and listened to the sounds that had been recorded, I swear to you, I started shaking all over again . It sounded exactly like what I had heard- Exactly- except what I heard was very close to me. This is the bad part of it all - When I called the game warden to tell him what I had heard and ask if there was any animal here that could make this sound, he said some sort of canine maybe . I said ""No Sure, it wasn't any kind of dog or coyote or fox or crane - ( which is what my husband said it could have been-but no it was no crane . I've heard cranes before and they do make a scary sound, but it wasn't a crane.) or any kind of cat , I've never heard anything make a sound like I had heard in real life before. ) He then ask "" what did it sound like?"" I hesitated for a second or two before I said "" A Bigfoot "" He said back to me ""well, like said it could be some sort of canine or something like that."" When he said that, I started crying - I couldn't help myself, I cried and told him that this was no joke that I was serious and that I was scared to death now . I believe he was thinking he had real nut case on the phone crying, telling him how scared she was cause she heard a BIGFOOT in the woods behind her house. I think he got a good laugh out of it anyway . Please believe me every word I've put down on this page is true . There is something in the woods behind my house that hollers, howls and I'm very scared of what it could be . I didn't see what it was and I pray to God that I never do, I did hear it and I also pray to God that I won't hear it again . But with God as my witness this is true . One more thing I would like to say that I have wondered about. I mentioned the tractor pull and I've wondered if maybe the sounds the tractors were making when they would start to pull -the winding up sound of the motors could have been the reason this thing was hollering-maybe it thought there was another one around calling to it but in fact it was the tractors, I don't know. I've thought about what everyone around where I live would be saying about me if they found out that I said I had heard bigfoot in the woods behind my house. If no evidence could be found to show that what I was saying was true, I would have big looney toon wrote across my back as long as I live here, I would be laughed at by everybody. Iv'e decided that I and only I know what I heard and I know how it's affected me -I feel like I've had a close encounter with evil - something I had heard might exist but I didn't really ever want find out if they did, especially from personal experience . I know that I and only I will have to deal with this feeling and that I don't really care what people here say as long as I know I'm telling the truth . If somehow someone did this as a hoax, (no way) they did a great job. I'd have to say that they're professionals. No way is this a hoax on my part. I've never been more serious about anything before as I am about this. Because I am so afraid here now, especially at night, I called the game warden back today and asked if could investigate this just to see if there might be evidence that this thing might have been or might still be in the woods here. He said that they hadn't had anyone else report anything like this but he would check it out. I don't know if he will or not. The answer to my prayers would be for him to investigate it, find it, catch it, and take as far away from my house as he could go. Now that I've wrote all this down and hopefully been able to convince you that this is not o hoax- I only hope that your sight is no hoax!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,howling,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,sounded as if a deer had been caught,1,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=15597

As I got about 2/3rds. up the hill I had the hair on my neck stand up and a feeling like I was being watched. This was around 5:00pm. I just casually kept walking till I got home always checking my back. It happened again within a week. Maybe a few days. Did not smell anything cause I had been fishing or no smell anyway. Wasn't long afterwards I was checking on the clouds of a thunderstorm when lightning struck close to the trailer. By this I mean I had my head out the door. I heard a yell about 70yds. behind the trailer. It didn't sound like a cow but I checked anyway. No cows had been in the area for at least 6 months. The scream was high pitched without coming down a lot at the end. With my wife being there, I just closed the door and didn't say nothing. I would say the following Sunday afternoon, my wife went to church at 6:00pm. and I stayed home to watch TV. About 45 min. later, I was laying on the couch watching TV, when something had blacked out my window at the far end of my trailer. The window was 1ft. wide and 3ft. tall. I had raised up to look out my picture window above the couch and it turned the corner and walked around the steps at the back door. It was looking off into the woods and as it kept walking, it looked at the ground. Understand this though, I had clear plastic on my window to keep heat in from winter.(Hadn't taken it down yet.) When it got to the window, I had already laid back down on the couch, looking up and lay still. It looked down at me and kept walking, hopefully. I laid there for about as long as I could stand maybe a minute. Then I got off the couch by sliding on the floor, went and got my gun walked back in the living room and waited a minute, then went outside making all noise I could. I checked the back of the trailer, nothing there. Details of Bigfoot is as follows, he was about 7ft. tall maybe 7ft.3"". Solid black, no white or brown that I could see. Remember the plastic. His head was more rounded and not cone shaped. I could not see the color of his eyes or anything like that. He was broad shouldered and thinner around the waist than what you usually see in the pictures and he walked more upright, not humped over like a gorilla. His hands hung around his thighs. The next morning around 10:00am., I got up from bed as I worked 2rd. shift then. My wife told me a friend of mine had come down to see me. I asked what did he want. She said she only saw him as the top of his head went across the kitchen window. We had to set the trailer on 4 blocks high and 3 on the other end, which meant you could not see anyone walking in front of the trailer, not out the kitchen window anyway. I told her my friend was 6'4"" and with a hat on you could not see him the way she had told me. We lived on rocky ground but I had one dusty dirt spot at the end of the trailer. Hoping he had walked in it. I checked and in the middle was a footprint. It was about 12 and a half inches long and 3 and half to 4 inches wide at the heel. Being dust it was only 1/4"" deep. There were only 3 toes which I did not understand at the time. I told some friends at work and one came to see it. The following Friday or Saturday night, he and a friend of his came over, no drinking sorry. And I told them the whole story. My friend was not hard to convince but his friend started talking big. So I told them let's go outside. Joking around to see how brave he was when we heard two dogs about medium to small size started barking and chasing something on the other ridge behind my trailer. Which was not far at all, maybe 200yds. They chased it into the small valley about 50yds. south of us. When one dog quit barking, the other gave one more then it was quiet. Stunned, we looked at each other and Bigfoot started running back towards us. It stopped about 80yds. from us and started to hit a tree with something that sounded like a branch about 4 to 5 inches thick. Then it ran closer to about 40yds. and done the same thing again. By this time all bravery was gone. I went back in the trailer and got my gun. Come back out and asked if anything had happened. The brave guy thought he might had seen something in the shadows south of us, light was on of course. They took the gun away from me and I didn't mind, thinking I had a way of escape. But we heard nothing else. My nearest neighbor is about 250 yds. away.( Mother-in-law) No one else for at least a mile. No reason to mess with us that I could even think of.

The creature stood 6-7ft tall and was staring directly back at me-it seemed to have fine hairs all over -grey color hair that got more black as the hair got closer to the skin--the tips of the hair were much lighter--the face (lips, eye lids, etc) were more of a very dark brown-it stood very erect, was very muscular, and did not seem to have the apelike protruding mouth and nose but more flat faced human like--after 30 seconds he started rocking back and forth--I then realized this was moving and could in no way be mistaken for a dear or bear or anything else--this was a fully erect apelike animal that seemed to want me see him --he was rocking back and forth from side to side. After the initial 30 seconds he rocked for about 10-12 seconds then stood and stared at me --I was on the 6th floor about 120 yards away in decent lighting due to hotel lights and street light behind loading area of hotel-he then would stare back then he would remain face forward with feet only about 2 feet apart would lean over to his left with his right arm would start pulling bark off a very large pine tree--it looked as if someone were in a sawing position--then he would stand up stare at me then rock and then pull bark--this was done in that order 3 times over a 5-6 minute period--after five minutes of re-verifying what I was looking at I felt this creature was docile and smooth moving--I decided I would try and get a closer look--as I opened the sliding glass door he stared and I stared back--I ran out of the hotel room and there was security in our hall laying the morning news at the hotel room doors--I asked him to come with me and asked for back up since he had no gun--we ran around the corner outside - as we were running I Finally got the nerves to tell them what I saw--we get to the reference points I had chosen and there were a lot of fresh bark removed from the large pine tree--I tried to pull bark from it to no avail -- it was too hard--I am 6'4"" 300 lbs. I went back after 7am (light) -- I did notice what looked like scat --it took the form of explosive diarrhea and looked like a hundred birds had pooped in a small area--like in a shotgun pattern-heavy in the middle and lighter to the outside perimeter-I put a large handful in a Marriott laundry plastic bag--It looks like feces and digested berries and seeds. (It was dry although it had rained the night before) One of the Marriott employee's saw two large footprints --more like deep indention's in the pine straw--I took off my shoe and placed my foot in it and there was about a one inch area all the way around my foot in order to fill the indention--Something very heavy had to make these indention's--I tried and I am 300lbs and could not.

(name removed by investigator) is just knowing each other from the window of our vehicle as we would wave to one another, as our children road the school buss with each other. i finally one day about 4yrs ago asked him what happened to his dogs, and told him the story of what i saw. he said one of the dogs died in huntsville alabama at his mothers home, and the other died at his home in honeycomb and he buried it behind his house. now. i didn't push the issue of letting me dig up the dog's corps as it would be kind of tacky. but if you guys want to contact me and send some investigators to check and see if mr. (name removed by investigator) would allow you to dig up the corps to see if its head is missing, you may get some clues or even some hair form the sasquatch. however if the head is still attached, then i was hallucinating the whole thing, and my wife would just imagined the water ripples too. i don’t do drugs, or smoke dope, and didn't at that time either. the only thing running thru my veins is good wholesome native american blood. i would love to participate in pursuing this investigation if there will be one.",1,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,dark,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,long hair,NA,"carrying dog head in left hand by the hair , road crossing",NA,road crossing,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,powerline cut nearby,1,"I spoke with the witness who recounted his experience as described in the report. The witness saw the animal from about 150 feet as it was walking into the lake. His view was from the animal’s left side. The witness described it as having long hair and described the hair color as being “dark” as he couldn’t discern the animal’s hair color. The witness estimated the creature’s height as being about 7 to 8 feet tall. The witness could clearly see the St. Bernard’s head being carried in the creature’s left hand. The St. Bernard’s head was being carried by the hair on top of its head, snout forward, and flesh could be seen hanging from the dog’s neck. The witness later spoke with the owner of the St. Bernard to inquire about why the dog hadn’t been seen in awhile. The owner of the dog said that the dog had died a couple of days previous and had been buried back in the woods behind his property. It is hypothesized that the buried St. Bernard was located by the creature, dug up, and head removed. The witness has suggested digging up the remains of the St. Bernard in order to confirm what he thinks he saw that night. Current forensic studies suggest that after 15 years, there would be very little left of the St. Bernard due to the natural process of decay as well as the scavenging of animals. The witness, who is very credible, has presented a case that offers the possibility of what appears to be very interesting sasquatch behavior. Editor's note (MM): This location is near a power line route. Sightings and related incidents often occur within a short distance of power line routes. This is true in both eastern and western states. Deer and elk often move and feed under power line routes. The trees and tall brush are cut away in these swaths, allowing berry bushes and grasses to flourish there. There is almost always a gravelled access road under power lines, but very little vehicle traffic throughout the year.",yes,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=18043

It showed no fear and did not so much as budge as we passed it, it did turn it's head and watch us as we drove by. Unlike a dog the creature had a human like face that was the only part of its body not covered in long reddish brown hair. Even seated on its haunches the creature was about the height of an average man. It was more slender in build than the average ""Bigfoot"" we have seen portrayed in reports of sightings in the northern part of the US.

The car was about 30 ft from the bottom of the ramp on the back porch and 20 ft from the north end of the car port (which is mostly open, except for a single partially closed in section on the north end). The night was dead silent with no wind. Upon reaching the bottom of the ramp I began to turn to my right towards the car when I heard what can only be described as similar to a bull snorting mixed with a grunt. I immediately turned towards the location of the sound, the back of the carport, and drew my sidearm. Due to a light on in the carport being pointed directly at me, I could not see what it was, but a shape. I had a small flashlight on me and pointed it at the thing. It didn't help much due to the light being in my eyes, but I was able to make out a creature bigger than me and at least 3 ft across at the shoulder. It made the sound again, but didn't move. I called out to it, thinking it was a person, but no response. After what felt like a few minutes, it made the sound again and seemed to get shorter. I began to move to my right towards the car to retrieve a rifle I kept in there and the thing moved to my left, so that we effectively circled each other until it reached the end of the carport on the south end. I reached the car and without turning, retrieved my rifle. As i pulled it out, the creature turned towards the woodline at the back of the property and seemed to either slowly run or quickly walk into the brush. i took this time to go back into the house and get a better flashlight. I came back out maybe 5 minutes later after finding one, to find nothing. The guard dog had reappeared and you could hear various insects around. The next morning I went to the area at the back of the property where the sighting had happened. From looking at disturbed spots on the ground I could tell that whatever it was, it had padded feet with a step of about 3-4ft., was between 7-9ft. tall, and moved in an upright fashion on two legs. Since then it hasn't been seen again, but there are times when the guard dog mysteriously disappears and there is no sound outside. the whole incident lasted 10 mts. or so. To add, the dog is called a ""guard dog"" because if anything happens, he will be the first to leave. i.e, if he's there, nothing else is. Don't see the dog, you have a problem.

I was inside the house and his heating unit was running so they must have been very loud outside. I got up and went out on his back deck but by the time I got there they had stopped. I listened for about 10 minutes and heard nothing. The heating unit was next to the deck and was quite loud so I decided to go back inside. About the time I started to fall asleep it started again the howls lasted about 3 minutes. Then stopped I thought that it might be my friend snoring in the back bedroom but I don't believe this was so because the neighborhood dogs where barking throughout the area in response to the howls.

It was sitting on its knees like a person would. Then it stood up. When it stood up. The hair on back of my neck did. Me and it made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It turned and started running through the woods. I've seen and heard people run through the woods. Its stride was wider than any humans. When it ran it didn't bother dogging sticks and stuff. It just ran through the brush. After that I turned around and started paddling back to my truck. I went back down there that night to see if I could spot light it. I done a howl and waited to see if it would respond. But than I heard two knocks back to back. I knocked on a tree. It knocked back at me. But it was off in the distance.

Then three more splashes close by. The last appeared to be a rock. Slowing down he started looking in the direction the rocks came from. It was sitting on its knees much like a person. Upon standing up the creature and witness made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It appeared to be about 7ft tall and weighed around 400 + pounds. It had a shoulder width of about 3 1/2 ft. wide. The hair was a mix of black and gray along the lines of a raccoon. The hair length was approximately 4-5 inches in length; it was matted with mud up to the knees. It had an odor of fish and mildew. The head was conical, with an almost flat nose. The right hand that was wrapping around the tree as the creature was playing peek-a-boo was black. It appeared to be very stocky with little to no neck. After it was done watching the kayaker it turned and started running west through the woods. The witness stated that he is an avid coon hunter and has heard people walk through the woods. This did not bother to go around brush, it just went through it. After the encounter the young man had enough and paddled back to his truck. He returned that night to see if he could “spotlight” it. After a while he thought he would try a howl, no response, at first. Then two wood knocks were heard. He knocked back and received a knock back from the distance. But nothing was seen. This all takes place next to a wildlife refuge. While coon hunting on the refuge he has heard several different screams that he did not recognize.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=39383

Road 17,Lookout Mountain,NA,NA,NA,NA,2345,NA,NA,NA,NA,"hill, forest",pine trees,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I had noted on my Limestone, Alabama Spring 1978 sighting report that I would eventually submit other sightings that involved myself, others I know or did know or had learned from talking with others. I did not know it would be this long to submit them, but I have since married, had a child, lived in three different locations, had five different jobs among other things since I last submitted that Limestone, Alabama sighting. This sighting/encounter below involved myself, and two freinds, it unexpectdly and without intent being my second. The event I relate here happened to me and two friends in April of 1994 while I was attending Troy State University, Troy. I was undertaking graduate studies at the time. I lived in a campus dorm and had become friends with several people in the dorm and about campus. One of these friends stayed in a room a few doors down. He dated a young woman that stayed in the International House across campus. I had been studying on that paticular night I write of and had become bored with it. My friend knocked on the door and came in. I for the most part had an ""open door policy"". The door may be open, but knock before you enter so I'll know you are there. As Kevin and I talked we agreed to go pick up his girlfriend, Donna and go to ""Lookout Mountain"". I had been out to the place once before during the day about a month earlier so I offered to drive. We left campus around 11 pm or so. We headed up Hyw. 231 north. About 8 miles from the Campus we turned west/northwest (left) onto Co. Rd. 17 As we got closer to the so-called Lookout Mountian we noticed fewer and fewer houses. After about 15 minutes of driving we had found it and proceeded to park just off the road. We got out of my vehicle and then walked up to the top of this large hill. The hill is about 100 feet high from what I remember. It is supposedly the highest point in Pike County. The place seemed to be a well known and well used spot with open areas about the path to the top, besides one could see for several miles to the west, south and east from atop this hill. I recall seeing the rotating beacon that night at the Troy Airport several miles to the south. I knew we were not the first people to walk to the top and hang out nor were we going to be the last. Everything seemed cool. After about 15 to 20 minutes we three decided to head downhill toward the car and find something else to get into. I think we had decided we were going to go to Subway for a late night snack. Now here is where it got weird. Just after we started downhill I began getting a funny feeling and the hairs started to rise on the back of my neck, like something was there and we were being watched. Seeing how we were out at night in the country plus having a lady with us, Kevin and I had decided not to be foolish. We had both brought along weapons. I had a Colt .38 stuffed in the back of my pants in its holster and a few extra rounds in my pocket plus a good sharp replica Samurai sword. (Yes, a sword). My friend had a Glock 9mm and an extra magazine of rounds. My friend was in the National Guard at the time. I pulled out the .38 before we got even midway downhill. I had looked over to where Kevin and Donna were to my right. He had already taken out his 9mm so I knew he also sensed something by then as well. It was also about this time that we started hearing rather heavy footsteps. As we moved along I notcied the steps were on both sides of us. By the time we had arrived midway downhill we were aware that there were five maybe six...somebodys or somethings out not far from us. I recall that there were two and I'm pretty sure a third distinct grouping of footfalls to my left and two off to my right. Kevin was closest to the ones on my right so I'm sure he had heard them much better. Also by this time our Donna had become almost hysterical. I'm sure her few screams did not help matters much. Kevin said that it might be some other people messing with us like Frat boys. We stopped breifly. He shouted a few warnings that whomever was there had better leave us alone or speak up, he was ready to open fire. No answers. Nothing. I remained quiet, listening. Now any person in their right mind (perhaps even in a drunken state of mind) would have said something in order to keep from being shot at, I would think, yet there were no answers, no response of any sort. Just slience. We then continued to move downhill toward my vehicle but whatever they were kept back a bit and out of our sight and also to our sides yet they kept moving down along with us, not trying to hide their footfalls. As we approached the bottom of the hill we ran for it, got into the my car as fast as we could, cranked it up quickly, backed up, and took off back the way we had came. I am not sure if whatever they were moved out into the dirt road behind us or not as we drove off. I looked back but, it was really too dark to tell. Aside from that the road was narrow and had trees along each side of it and I was being as careful as I possibly could so as not to run off this road. I don't recommend under such cirmstances trying to drive out of such a place and look back at the same time. It took several minutes after we got back onto Hwy. 231 for Donna to calm down. I was shaken up but not too bad. I suppose the driving had something to do with it. I'm not sure how Kevin felt. I assume that his military training had taken over for a time back on that hill. We never saw what they were. Except for the footsteps they were otherwise quiet. At first I was not sure what they may have been however after considering the strange activites I felt they could very well have been bigfoots. I still feel that is what they were though I can never be 100% sure. Even so, what they did while we were on Lookout Mountain would seem much like reported and researched bigfoot behavior. After a few months and leaving Grad school I eventually lost contact with those two friends. I've not been back to Lookout Mountain since even though I have traveled up and down that part of 231 near there many times. I'm sure with a little driving about those dirt roads off Co. Rd. 17 I can find that hill again. I'm just not too sure I'd want to find it once again at night.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,potential stalking,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,"Witness stated that the footfalls were definitely those of heavy bipeds.

My girlfriend's father was sitting on the hood of the car with his fishing pole in front of him. He was night cat-fishing. While we sat there, with the car lights shining across the river, my girlfriend and I were sitting in the front seat just making small-talk (honest), when all of a sudden I heard the most horribly incredible scream coming from my right side. To set the scene: Our car was parked about two feet from the water, on the bank. Off to my right about 60 feet was where the foliage began. Very swampy, very thick, and very hard to walk through. About 40 feet further up the bank (which can't be seen from our car because of the foliage) is a huge oak tree. I'd have to guess that the tree had about a 15 foot circumference - massive! About 10 feet up the tree is a huge branch that went about 20 feet out over the river. My friends and I would climb the tree and jump/dive into the river at least once every couple of weeks or so. During one occasion, there were about 9 of us standing on this branch attempting to make it move - we barely made it do anything, let alone shake! Anyway, back to the car. As I heard the scream, my body instantly went into what I think was shock. As I turned to my right s.l.o.w.l.y.. with all my hair standing straight-up, we heard the next sound~~~> a chuuu..chuuu..chuuu..chuuuuuuu... (my feeble attempt to describe the sound of that huge branch I mentioned earlier that was shaking due to something GIGANTIC jumping off it into the water. The splash that came next was equally as horrific. All we did was just sit there in shock...waiting (I don't know why), staring at this point - straight ahead at the water. My guess is that we were waiting for the thing to float into our headlights. We waited and waited and waited and all of a sudden an object - black - long - I would guess at least 9-10 feet, floated into our headlights and stopped. Please keep in mind that this action was deliberate, because it was floating downstream. We stared at it forever it seemed.until it opened it's eyes - two huge balls of red (reflecting off the headlights of our car I imagine) light and looked at us.

At that time, I believed I saw a crazy old man, but I now realize that is all I could rationalize it to be. I was walking alone at dusk with my dog. This was not unusual as I loved to be outside- my parents often had to force me inside by calling me in for the night. Well, from what I can remember of that particular night, I was picking up rocks in a ditch and looking at them. I might have been looking for a certain kind of rock but I can't remember exactly what I was doing. It was definitely getting dark, but I could still see well enough to keep after the rocks for awhile longer. I remember holding a stick I was using to pry rocks out of the dirt. It was very quiet and still and there wasn't much wind. As I was looking at the ground, I heard a noise in front of me and I looked up to see what it was, and that is when I saw him. He stood right in front of me at a distance of 5 to 10 feet, he was tall, but hunched and quietly staring right at me. He wasn't much taller than a normal man, but I got the impression he was old because he was hunching. He looked like Rip Van Winkle to me, and that is what I thought of when I saw him. He had a long shaggy beard around his facial area, but he was completely naked but for the long shaggy hair that was in matts all over his body. I remember the hair was thin at his face, the base of his neck, and upper torso, but thicker around his beard, lower torso and legs. All the hair was grayish white and very long and shaggy. Mats of hair dangled from him in tatters. His feet were bare. His face was very humanlike, but not quite normal as it had very exaggerated wrinkles- again, a reason I thought he was a crazy old man. His head seemed normal, but there was so much hair it was hard to make out his features except where the hair was thinner. He appeared gaunt and thin, but in just a moment I would realize he was not like an old man at all. I screamed as loud as I could out of fear and I noticed my dog bolted towards the house while I was taking in the sight of this strange thing in front of me. The shaggy old man let out a scream of his own when I screamed. He was staring right at me screaming in a voice that sounded like a woman shrieking- he seemed very scared of me as well. I turned to run for my house. I looked over my shoulder to see if he was following me and I saw him run up the ditch in the other direction. He was extremely agile and fast- he was definitely not Rip Van Winkle. He ran in a full sprint, very quickly for someone so hunched. I think I caught the dog running back to the house, as I was so frightened. I remember running into the kitchen and telling my Mom there was a crazy old Rip Van Winkle in the field. I remember describing how he was old looking, hunched, naked, and his hair was very long and matted like he hadn't cut it in 20 years. I told her about how he had hair all over his body. Needless to say, I wasn't believed. I became obsessed with what I called ""the Shaggy old man"" or ""the Crazy old man"". I believed that he must have been an old deformed hermit. I kept a notebook in which I drew many sketches of him. I remember keeping the notebook secret from my family, hiding it out of fear of being ridiculed. I wish I had those sketches now but sadly I've misplaced that notebook. I remember I went back to the spot in the field looking for him on other occasions, but I never ran into him again. I wasn't aware enough to look for prints or anything like that, but I knew that he was out there somewhere and I wanted to prove he really existed to others. What changed my opinion of this sighting was a late night visit to a bigfoot website. I was just browsing their sightings index and I came across several sightings in the same county I lived in and all described white or grayish colored creatures. Honestly, I didn't realize bigfoot were sighted in this part of the country at that time, or even for most of my life, and just seeing all those other sightings was a revelation. I realized for the first time that what I witnessed may not have been a crazy old shaggy man, but rather a bigfoot. When I think back on the sighting, it all makes sense in that light. There would be no reason for a naked old man to wander that field, much less to be covered in grayish, white, shaggy tattered hair. The only reason I never thought of it as a bigfoot before was that I had never heard of an Alabama bigfoot, so the thought never entered my mind. Also, I had never heard of a whitish gray colored bigfoot, and this creature was thinner than a typical bigfoot description- maybe he was older or maybe even younger. He looked a bit hungry to me, as he was not some hulking powerful creature, but he was still strong looking and extremely agile.",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,grey white,6,grey,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,thin,stooped,NA,"exagerated wrinkles on face , matted hair , resembles ""Rip Van Winkle"" , hair culminated into beard",M,"staring at witness , retreated from witness after screaming , fleeing",yes,hunched posture,bipedal,high pitch scream after witness screamed at it,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"During a phone conversation with this observant, articulate witness, a few more details surfaced.

As the hunter’s eyes adjusted to the shadows of the tree line, he was surprised to see a gray creature about 8 foot tall, very muscular, playing peak a boo from behind an oak tree. The hunter grabbed his son by his hoodie and ran back down the mountain. The next sighting was several months ago. The wife was up about 4 am getting ready for work. Both adults smoke but not in the house. The wife was in the bathroom with the window open, blowing the smoke out. The yard light in the back casts a shadow on the tree line, which has been measured at 9ft. The wife spots a large figure cross over the 9 foot shadow cast by the light, moving just along the tree line. The dog “Red” that only barks at possums and people, was going nuts barking while the other dog howled. The figure faded back into the shadows. The most recent incident was in May of this year.

Towards night fall we started fishing back toward the launch. about 11:30 we were fishing a secluded part of the shoreline. The nearest house was probably 2-3 miles down river. We were fishing close to the bank when I heard something walking at the top of the hill. I figured it was a deer and didn't pay it any more attention.

I thought I was hearing things so I looked back at my buddy and he was looking up the hill towards the sound.

He walked over to it and stated that he wondered what might have made such a large pile. As he looked around for horse or cow tracks, another person walked over to look at it and said ""Look at the size of these foot prints"". They all began looking around and found tracks coming out of a grassy area onto a dirt road. The tracks went about 20 feet then turned left into the freshly plowed field (plowed the day before). They proceded about 30 feet into the field. There you could tell where it paused to squat repositioning it's feet to do so and did it's business. While in this position it dug up some turtle eggs in front of it and ate them leaving broken shell behind. The feces were the consistancy of horse droppings in that they were of high fiber content and contained undigested muscadines(a kind of wild grape). But the droppings weren't in the shape of horse manure,(round ballshaped piles) but were long and cylindrical like that of a dog or human. The feces(2) were about 18-24 inches long and about 2 1/2-3 inches across. Rather large I must say. The tracks then turned left again into an area of tall grass, small pines and other small trees that lined a field at the edge of the woods. I wasn't able to follow them very far due to dead branchs, briars and undergrowth that blocked my progress. Plus I was wearing only sandals, shorts, and a tank top. Not prepared to trek through the woods. I took pictures of the tracks and the feces with a yardstick for size comparison. I also took a specimen of the feces and turtle egg shells which are still in my freezer. I have a cast of a left and right foot. The right one broke trying to pick it up but is still n pretty good shape. The left one is completely intact. They measure approx 18 inches long, 8 inches wide at the toes and 4 1/2 inches at the heels. The stride measured 3 feet from the toe of one foot to the heel of the next step. Each foot has 5 toes. A humanlike large toe on the inside of the step and each toe following being smaller than the last. There is an arch to both, showing it is not flatfooted. I took these samples to the Univesity of Alabama and showed them to a professor who is an anthropology professor in forensics. I walked away disappointed to hear him insist that what I had were Bear tracks. But he had been on a bear trip since I had spoken to him a few days prior about my find. When I arrived at his office, before he even looked at the cast he was talking bears and showing me books and pictures of bears and bear tracks. I tried to say Bears don't have a Big toe, but he tried to make up reasons that these tracks of a ""bear"" had a big toe. I realized this person was not going to believe what he was looking at was not a bear. It either frightened him to think it was a possible Bigfoot out there or he was embarassed to say he didn't know what it was. Just a ""Bear"". Well there is our encounter of a Track sighting.

They showed me the place where the tracks were found, but it had since rained and the tracks were no longer present. They also showed me a shooting house (for deer hunting) which had been broken and overturned. They then showed me the photos and casts of the tracks, which were just as described in this report. I examined the casts carefully, looking for any sign that they could have been faked. I found no such indication. The size and shape of the tracks plus the step interval definitely DO NOT indicate bear. The witnesses first thought was that someone must be playing a practical joke on them, but the fecal evidence and the tracks just seemed too definitive to dismiss or explain away as a joke, especially considering the fifty-four inch step interval they measured. Photographs of the tracks and casts were also sent to experts within the BFRO for analysis. The witnesses did not insist that there was a real Sasquatch present at the property; they simply wanted help in determining whether the evidence was hoaxed or is genuine. I saw no indications that point in the direction of hoaxed evidence. Evidence collected by the witness was sent by the BFRO for scientific analysis, but the analysis proved inconclusive and does not contribute to our understanding of this event at this time.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=6938

My husband and I have heard screams in the woods from some kind of animal that is so loud and it has a long guttural yell that sounds like a man... We have never heard anything like this. This has been going on now for three weeks in March 2012, almost every night just about 8:30, or right before it getting dark. Then it stops for about a month, and now it has started back up again. I have lived in the country all my life and I am 52 and my husband is 66 years old. We are not a bunch of kids making these things up. I know what cougars, coyotes, bears and wolves all sound like. We have never heard anything like this in the woods before... Other then fourteen years ago, my son who is in the Army and still is to this day. He and I were sitting outside one night at 11:00 talking... We heard the same thing yell out then... It came from behind my house and it yells out in that long guttural yell three times and after the third time it sounded like there was 50 or more coyotes were surrounding us and they stated yapping like crazy. ... The recent sounds are coming between my Grandfather's old house place and my home... It is about a 1/2 mile away. We have a huge lake behind us and nothing but woods... My grandfather has some old abandoned gravel pits and lakes close by too.. There is a swamp in front of our home about 1/4 mile away. I was also told when I was a child that back in the 1930’s my grandfather went through the gravel pit one night ... He saw something setting on a hill that looked like a huge hairy thing that had a face like a man.... This was before all the media hype from the Patterson films.. I need help because this thing is getting closer to our home. My husband doesn't have good hearing and he said he could hear it upstairs one night and it sounded like it was in the yard. We have animals, Cattle and Donkeys here we don't know whether to shoot at the sounds from where it is coming from or what... On March 31, 2012, it sounded like it was right down at the bottom of the holler right past our fence ... It sounded like TWO of whatever this thing is, was mad and was yelling at us. I got so scared I took off running into the house.... I have never been so frightened in my life, and believe me when I say I go outside a lot at night by myself I really do, we have a huge wraparound porch I love to listen to the owls and whippoorwill at night but nothing like this has ever happen to me before.... Last week I went to put my puppy up for the night in our garage then I heard whatever this thing is, let out a scream, I called for my husband to come home it was back. When he got here we heard it growl. It came from the same area as before. Like I said before we heard it just about every night for 3 ½ weeks and then nothing… That night I told my husband HE BACK! Then the next night we heard it again but this time down in front our house down at the swamp.

I found their accounts to be consistent and believable. There were two sightings and the following can be added to the report: The first sighting was in 2011 at noon with the mom and son both witnessing the creature from their car. This route is driven by both witnesses daily. The hair was dark brown, long, shaggy and matted. The legs and hips were extremely thick and full of muscles. The height was estimated at seven feet and weight at 350 pounds with no fat noted. It crossed the road and into the woods in about three seconds. It moved very fast, running left to right on two legs. It used its hands and arms to shield its face as it sprinted into the thick undergrowth and branches. They were driving at 30 MPH when she hit the brakes. The biped was about 15 feet from the bumper by the time she stopped. The second sighting was in April of 2014 at 9 pm and happened within a few feet of the first sighting. The son was alone and driving home during the second sighting. The creature was dark in color and about the same size as the one seen in 2011 with a thick back noted. The creature dropped down low and ran away into the woods on the left side of the road when the high beams hit it. The two witnesses went to the location of the two sightings the following day, found and photographed some possible formations made from small, twisted branches and broken branches on the ground. We have reviewed the photos, not enough detail is seen to determine whether or not they were made with hands or if the branches broke and the sticks fell that way naturally. In August of 2014 at 2 am, the son's friend drove up to his house and a biped could be seen walking inside a wood line behind the house. It stepped behind a tree when the high beams were turned on. Eye-shine was then seen peeking out to the left then right side of the tree, back and forth for about 20 minutes before the eye-shine disappeared. The eyes were determined to be about 8 feet off the ground after inspecting the area with his friend the next day. This happened about half a mile from the other two sightings.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=44849

I was 14 years old. I was at home in my living room watching TV and my brother was outside working on a car. We were the only ones at home. The front door was located in the living room. We never used this door because we had no steps to it and the door was about 4 feet from the ground. So we used the back door of the house. I was sitting on the couch watching TV when the door began to move and the door knob was turning. The only thing holding the door shut was a nail someone had nailed at the top of the wall and bent it over to hold the door shut. I first thought it was my brother but he knew we didn't use the door. As the door was moving just a little I noticed at the bottom of the door where there was a gap, 3 fingers slide under the door. My heart began to beat faster, I tried to move but I couldn't at first. Then I wanted so bad to look out the window beside the door but I was too scared. These fingers were very long and the nails were long too and black. The hand like finger had hair on it dark brown. The hair was long. This only lasted for 3 min. When the fingers move out from the gap the door knob and the door stop moving. About 45 min. later my brother came inside and I asked him why he was trying to use the front door he said he hadn't. I didn't tell him what happened until sometime later.

The fingers were bending upwards under the bottom of the door. Only the back of the fingers could be seen and no skin could be seen because of the 1.5 inch long hair. The fingers were approximately 50% longer than a normal man’s and about 1 inch in diameter. The nails were narrower in proportion to a human's and about .5 inch long past the finger tips.

I 've been in the woods enough to know it was not an owl or like any sound I've EVER heard in the woods or on a river. Too loud, too powerful. It felt like it came frome about a quarter to a half mile away. It scared the piss out of me. You've never seen a guy hustle a 75 lbs canoe on their shoulders and practically run up the hill. I didn't even tie it on properly until I got up to the highway. The weird part was I had been watching the Monster Quest series and the month before had come down the same river and thought ""This area looks just like that crap they show in the Pacific Northwest where those bogfoots are. Wonder if there were ever any bigfoots in Alabama?"" So I did an internet search and it surprised the crap out of me and found a whole freakin website about Alabama Bigfoots. Those sounds I heard sounded just like the whoops you have on this web site. Of course after watching those shows it could have been somebody doing that call blasting thing but I had emailed the Alabama Research people and they said they did not have anyone working that area at that time(AUG 2010). Over the last year I have had a few ""unusual"" moments in this area. No sightings but well, I'm short on time. The WHOOOPS were the important thing, scared the hell out of me.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,whooping and rock throwing,NA,NA,NA,whoops,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"I spoke with Mr. Johnson over the phone about his report. He spends a great deal of time canoeing, fishing, and camping in the area. The initial report covered the majority of the details, but he did add that approximately 20 minutes before he landed his canoe, he let out a series of ""whoops"" just for fun. He is interested in the bigfoot phenomenon and uses his time in the outdoors to also look for evidence. We talked about the other unusual things that happened to him while in the area. One night, while he was camping in a primitive location, he woke at 4 AM to footsteps outside his tent. He was camping alone, and was in an area not easily accessible. On another occasion in the area, he was fishing at dusk and noticed the area had become eerily quiet. He did a few ""whoop"" calls and began to hear something in the brush behind him. Unable to see it, he threw a tangerine at the sound. He went back to fishing only to notice something hit the water near him. He thought it may have been something falling off a tree, until a second rock was thrown. He noticed that it was angled and had a trajectory. He left the area as quickly as possible. Mr. Johnson had also experienced extremely foul smells while in the area, but is unsure of the source. He said it could've been the wind picking up a dead animal smell.",yes,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=30680

Two 2x4 cross members holding the chicken wires at the top, about 8 feet off the ground, were ripped down, and their two chickens were on the ground with their necks broken. Also, many of their caged quail located in the same barn have disappeared over time at night from an enclosure which requires hands to open. The cage is always shut the next morning. The second sighting occurred on November 2, 2013 around 4:45 PM, about one hour before sunset. Mrs. X was closing the back doors of their barn when she thought she saw movement in the woods downhill in her peripheral vision. As she was shutting the second half of the doors, she caught sight of movement again. She looked up straight at a creature, estimated between 7.5 and 8 feet tall, which froze staring back at her from 110 feet away. It was facing her. She estimated the weight at 450 lbs. The shoulder width was estimated at 3 feet. It had dark brown hair, with an orange tint, covering its entire head and body from 2-4 inches long. The face was completely covered with short hair of the same color. The legs were slightly apart. The feet were out of sight because of the curvature of the downhill slope. The arms were hanging straight down with human like hands. The creature quickly turned to its left and bounded diagonally away down the steep hill with long, straight-legged hops similar to what a deer might do. The arms were swinging right foot and right hand forward, left foot and left hand forward. The stride was 6-7 feet from the measurements Mr. X took in the leaf litter. The sounds went out of sight, over a 4-foot fence, and on down the very steep hillside out of hearing range. This sketch below depicts approximately what the witness saw before the creature fled. With both sightings, the wife said the creature behaved as if it was more afraid of her than she was of it and that she believes it was the same creature. On 12/4/13, Mrs. X was checking the greens in the garden next to the house, which rests between the two previous sighting locations. She found three fresh bare foot prints 9 inches long and 5 inches wide. There were 2 lefts and 1 right. Here is the best photo: Dermal ridges were present on one of the casts. A set of small deer tracks were also present. The track casting took place at night, just as rain moved in. A rock was thrown and landed less than ten feet from the couple and the print being cast at the time. There was also banging on the back side of the barn while casting (where the second sighting took place). Afterwards, it was noted that the newly installed, tight chicken coup wire had been stretched in a spherical shape about 18” off the ground. It was still stretched tight and flat before the casting started. One of their new chickens was rousting in the rafters instead of their normal rousting place which had never happened before. The impression in the wire was made by something at least as big as a basketball. I got down on all fours and pushed my head into the spherical impression. I found I was looking through an 18” opening in the barn wall straight at where the tracks were being cast. Screams and howls have been heard for several months.

These six square miles of woods are a mix of hardwood and evergreen private land with mostly no hunting. All signs of activity ended when deer season ended.

(The narrow patch of woods then stretched on northward.) Leaves were on the ground. That was the first thing that impinged on my consciousness -- the sound of something walking through leaves. It was a measured long tread, I could tell. I started really looking around trying to see what was making those sounds. (I was much braver back then.) Then over on the other side of the ravine close to the bottom but definitely walking uphill, I saw it. For all of about three seconds, seemed like longer at the time, and about 50-100 yards away. It was very large and I could see that it was hairy. I could see the ground between it's moving legs, and some vague image of arms, but not the head. Some forest branch obscured my view of the very top part of the body. I could tell it was walking upright uphill. It wasn't a bear; it was striding with a purpose up the hill on the other side. It was quickly out of sight. Now I know I wasn't thinking clearly, because I decided I had to try to get a better look at it. So I ran as quickly as I could around the rim of the ravine, since it's origins began in our front yard (not the best playground I can tell you). Anyway, it didn't take me long to reach the other side and move down into the woods slightly to look around and see if I could find it again. I did not see it again. I was there for only a minute or so when it suddenly occurred to me that I didn't hear anything anymore at all, no sound, no birds, no nothing, and fear like I'd never known before hit me and I went running practically screaming back to the house for mother. I told her what I'd seen and she, of course, did not believe me, though she told me to never tell anyone else the story. For a long time I didn't tell anyone, except family members, but they didn't believe. It didn't help that only one or two people since then truly believe that I saw a BigFoot. Since then I have lots of trouble going out alone in the woods.

We were staying at a motel in BullShoals. One morning we drove to a remote area of the river to fish via an unkown dirt road. We stopped to fish a bend of the river. On the opposite side of the river(west), was a tall stone bluff with a slight over crop from erosion. On the east side was flatter land with 12 to 20 foot thin scrub trees about 20 to 30 feet from the water, as the river was low. While my mother and aunt where fishing off the bank, I decided to try my luck further up river, about 300 yards away and just out of sight with my mother. While I was fishing along the bank I began to hear rustling sounds in the trees and shrubs behind me. I looked in the direction of the noise and could see the tops of the these thin trees moving as if something were walking through them and pushing them to the side, but due to the thickness of the vegetation I could not see what was actually moving the trees. I stood and observed this activity for 2 or 3 minutes. I began hearing grunting type sounds that were very deep and substantial sounding. These sounds were similar but different than grunt sounds a bull would make. The movement of the trees began to appear as if something were shaking the trees at this point instead of moving through them. It appeared that whatever was making the noises was only about 10 feet inside the brush yet I could not see what it was. Feeling nervous, I decided I should return to my mothers side and began walking back towards my mother. As I did, whatever was in the brush moved with me step for step. As I walked the movement in the trees seemed more forceful with the sounds of large branches breaking as it moved. When I got within sight of my mother (about 50 yards), all activity stopped. I informed my mother there was something in the brush following me, but she shrugged it off.

He had gone fishing on the White River with his mother and aunt in the morning (he estimates 10 AM as it was just starting to get really warm outside) in a remote area near Norfork . They weren’t having any luck and he wandered up the river around a bend and out of sight of his mother and aunt to see if he’d have better luck fishing. Soon afterwards he described hearing very deep grunts, snorts and heavy breathing sounds coming from some thick vegetation approximately 20 feet behind him. He said at the time he was 13 years old and the thought of a Bigfoot never crossed his mind. He thought it was probably a deer or a cow and didn’t feel overly concerned. He could see branches moving and shaking in the vegetation, but was never able to see what was there. He described the grunting sounds as “whoooooomp” and said they sounded very deep mixed with snort-type sounds and a heavy breathing as from a large animal. He listened and watched for a few minutes trying to see if he could make anything out in the vegetation and finally decided he should head back to where his mother and aunt were. As he was walking back whatever had been in the vegetation began following him at which point he started feeling nervous. He felt like he was being watched. He describes the area he was walking next to as very dense with very thick scrub brush with dense cane-like trees that were about 15 feet tall, 2 – 3 inches in diameter and very sparse with few branches. He said it sounded like it was very close and he should have been able to see it, but wasn’t able to. He could see the trees moving as whatever was paralleling him seemed to be pushing through the trees and said it looked like it was grabbing the trees and holding them aside as it pushed through. He continued to hear occasional “whooooomps” and grunts and stated it didn’t sound the way a hoofed animal would walk on four legs, but more like it had two legs and was loudly breaking and snapping branches as it walked. He stopped on two occasions trying to see what it was at which point whatever it was stopped as well. As he approached the area where his mother and aunt were and gained sight of them, the sounds stopped completely in an area where the thick scrub brush and trees came to an end near a clearing. He told his mother he was being followed by something and she seemed to shrug it off and they prepared to leave. He said he watched the area intently where the sounds had stopped at as they prepared to leave but never saw anything. He has been fishing in this area several times now that he’s an adult, but been unable to find the location where this occurred to him as a child. He continues to look, however.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=7969

They had caught their limit and were driving home. They drove across the Highway #101 bridge -due south across the lake and then west - to reach U.S. Highway #62. As they were nearing highway 62 and slowing for the stop sign at the intersection, they were startled to see in the beams of the vehicle's headlights a tall dark figure walking upright down the embankment on the west (passenger's side) of the road. It then made one long jumping step to the road's center line where it briefly paused, turned to look closely at the vehicle and passengers. Both men stated the animal then dropped with its knuckles on the ground, and ""swung his body through its arms and leaped several feet high into a pine thicket alongside the road where it disappeared from view."" In speaking with the witnesses by phone they both agreed the animal was over seven feet tall, with a very muscular body and covered in dark brown, shaggy hair. They assumed that it was a male but could not be certain that it was. Both men believe the animal was not a mature adult. When the animal disappeared, the driver turned to his friend and asked if he had seen what had happened. He replied that he had. Both men decided that they would not discuss the incident with others for a while. The submitting witness described the landscape as ""wood government lake strip."" To expand on his description, the investigator has added the following comment. The area is within the Ozark Mountains, and is about ten miles due south of the Missouri state line. The sighting occurred near Norfork Lake which is a U.S. Corps of Engineers lake which covers about 22,00 acres. The event occurred near one of the corps' fenced service areas. During our discussion of the event the men mentioned there was a ""Catfish Restaurant"" not far from the sighting location. The animal had come from that direction when seen, and disappeared from view down a hollow that entered the lake and formed Panther Bay. There have been numerous reports from this and other Arkansas lakes of enigmatic primates routinely checking containers near fish cleaning stations. During the Investigator's several discussions with the primary submitter of this report, he mentioned an unusual audible event which he heard along the lake near his home three years ago. He said that event was partially the reason for him submitting this primary encounter which occurred thirteen years earlier. He said that he was fishing off the bank of the lake near his home late at night. It was calm and cold. Directly across the lake was a ridge that formed a peninsula. He suddenly heard a large pack of coyotes high on the ridge excitedly vocalizing and moving down toward the lake. When the canines were about halfway down the ridge, they became silent. Immediately, from a location on the ridge closer to the lake, he heard two or three loud and quick noises like a hollow tree being struck by a heavy object followed by loud whooping sounds. At once the coyotes began frantically vocalizing and moving back up the ridge. Within a few seconds, the tree beating and whooping sounds were repeated, although he could tell they came from much further up the ridge. The witness said the same sequence of sounds, continued for about two miles up the ridge at an incredible speed, with the knocking and whooping sounds getting closer to the coyotes constantly. Near the top of the ridge all the sounds stopped. The witness stated he recorded the sounds on a cell phone, and when he listened to it later he was able to hear other whooping sounds that he had been unable to hear as the event occurred. (He said that unfortunately the recording was accidentally erased from that phone.) After speaking with both witnesses it was evident that both were credible observers.",yes,yes,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=55376

One Day we got on the subject i was telling him that i had bought a little book of ghost stories and bigfoot sightings and how i was very itrested in bigfoot. Then he told me that he seen bigfoot before and he told me the whole story. At fist i didnt belive him, but a couple of years later he told me the same story when we got on the topic again. The story is that he was riding ATVs with his friends around or in ether lost bridge lake of bever lake and he was at the front of the group of 4-wheelers and they were going down this hill that led to a dirt road. Since he was in front of the group he went down first and got on the dirt road and stopped to wait for the rest of the group to come down. before they came down he lokked over across the dirt road on the other side of the hill on the tree line where the evevning sun was shining through the trees and seen the big foot walking. He said it was taking really big steps and apered to be 7-8 feet tall. He couldnt se the color because the sun was shining through the trees and big foot so you know it apeared as a shadow. Then the rest of the group came down and he told them what he saw and they didnt belive him. Thats all he told me. He told me he coudnt remeber every detale.

He retold his encounter to me honestly and matter of factly. Mr. G stated he and some friends were riding 4-wheelers in the Posey Mountain area and being somewhat of a daredevil, he was the first to go down a hill in this region. He said while waiting for his friends to come down the hill he rode around at the bottom to kill time. While looking up the other side of the hill he noted an animal standing bipedally appearing to reach up into the branches of a tree. Mr. G is an avid hunter and stated, in his opinion, this was no bear. His distance from the animal was approximately 150 feet. He stated it surprised him and he rode back to where his friends were urging them to go look. He stated by the time he got back to the area the sighting took place the creature turned and strode upright back over the crest of the hill and out of sight. He stated it was covered in hair from head to toe. He said he did not get a good look at the facial features, however, he felt they were hairy as well. He said the creature was thinner than would be expected for an upright bear with longer legs. and a long gait as it walked out of sight. He stated it walked smoothly more in keeping with a human gait than that of an animal. He said the animal's height he thought was around 6 feet, but could have been as much as 8 feet. He was unsure of this detail. His friends saw nothing as they were behind him. He said that he does not believe in UFO's or ghosts, or even bigfoot until this encounter. He is a little reluctant to call what he saw a bigfoot but was confident it was no bear or anything else native to the area. As stated earlier, his matter of fact attitude and clear retelling of the encounter leads me to believe this gentleman indeed observed a sasquatch.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=7045

He stated the hand was very large and that he remembers when the animal moved to cover its eyes, the hand was down below the knee area swinging upward to the face, covering it. He said he did not note whether there was a point on this animal's head because of the large hand obscuring the face. He could not say whether the hand had hair on the palm or whether it was dark skin, but was quite sure it was a hand and not a paw. This animal was brown in color with what appeared to be human like hair covering its body. When asked about the other occupants of the car he was sure they had all seen the animal because they originally thought it was a man on the side of the road miles from any town.

I said, ""did you hear that?"" and about that time this sound repeated two or three more times in succession. Two of the guys dismissed these as howls of a Husky breed of dog. One of these two owned a Husky in the past. However, this sound was much deeper than the sound I heard his dog or the coyotes make. It was almost exactly the same as the vocalizations I listened to on your website. It was not the screeching vocalizations. All the sounds appeared to be several hundred yards away. After that, no more sounds were heard. Neither the coyotes nor the other sound. I believe these were sounds from a Bigfoot. I did not tell of my suspitions, for I have only revealed my beliefs to the guy who owned the Husky. I felt as though the others may not believe me or make fun of the situation. It took me a while to get to sleep that night knowing that a Bigfoot may be in the area.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ohio howl 3 times with coyotes yipping,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,other witness said it sounded like a Husky,5,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=3032

From those conversations, the following details can be added to his initial report: The witness was driving a minivan west at night at a speed near 70 mph on Highway 82. The motorist said that he was about three miles inside Chicot County, AR, after having crossed the Mississippi River bridge from Greenville, MS. His wife was sitting in the front passenger's seat and was looking at her cell phone in her lap. Their children were asleep in the rear seat. The driver stated that he suddenly saw in the beam of the van's headlights ""a tall, large, greyish-haired creature, standing on his legs, run across the highway"" about three hundred feet in front of his van. The figure was running from a sparsely wooded area on the right (north) side of the highway and crossed the highway quickly in three long steps. It disappeared in a sparsely wooded area south of the highway. He stated the figure was uniformly covered in greyish hair of unknown length. It appeared that its body was ""solid and heavy,"" and seemed to be between six and eight feet tall. He said the figure's height was a rough estimate because at all times the figure was ""hunched over"" with its head also leaning slightly down. The figure never turned it head to look toward the van. Based on statements from the witness and this writer's familiarity with this area, it is believed the motorist saw the figure cross Highway 72 at the Ditch Bayou bridge. Highway 82 closely follows along the south side of Lake Chicot for about ten miles. Ditch Bayou is connected to Lake Chicot, which is noted for its abundance of large catfish, crappie and bass. The figure seen was leaving the lake area.

That particular day we had to paint some boundry line around an area near Biern, AR, just southwest of Gurdon, AR. It was in the afternoon and I had already finished ""brushing"" out the line for the others to paint the dots on the tree. I knew of an old black man that lived in a little shack not far from there. He ALWAYS had an old loggers helmet on, carried an ole filled 22, and only wore blue overalls and a white shirt. After I had finished, I made my way back to the truck which was on a road that was near the railroad tracks. These tracks went through the middle of Biern. As you pull into Biern from hwy 67, you cross these tracks and then turn right for approx. 2 miles. The road then T's and can go to the right to cross the tracks again. In 1984, the road only went about another 1\4 mile before turning back to the right back to 67. Our truck was parked on that last turn that goes back to hwy 67. I had made my way onto the tracks to wait for the others. I wasn't quite a 1\4 mile from where the road crosses over the tracks. The signs that let you know of the tracks are maybe 8 ft. high. When I noticed something on the tracks at that cross-over, I noticed that it ""appeared"" to be another foot taller. That could have been an optical illusion at that distance. I noticed that I could not see the silver hard hat that the old man always wore, or the white shirt, or the gun. This thing, what ever it might have been stopped on the trakcs and turned. But when it turned, it had to turn the whole upper torso as though it had a stiff neck. It was mostly dark in color, it did have some lighter spots on it. It appeared to take a step towards me when another logging companies truck gun it's motor and startled the creature. It seemed to notice this, turn and take two steps to get into the woods. If you have ever been down the tracks of the railroad, you know that it would be impossible for a normal man to make that kind of distance in only two steps. You have to take into consideration that I was only 18 at the time and still had a pretty vivid imagination. Even with the evidence I had at that time, I questioned what I might have really seen. It wasn't until later that I found out that there have been many sightings of some creature in that part of the woods. A buddy of mine told me that his grandmother lived in that area and had trouble from a two legged creature getting into her garbage at night. He said that there was only one time that the creature came up on her back porch and look into her window. She said that it looked somewhat like a monkey. She never admitted that she was scared because it never threatened her in any way. This story sort of validated mine. This is not the only time that I have seen a creature out int woods.

In a final telephone interview the witness clarified a few items and added others as follows: The ""shack tube"" mentioned above should have been a ""shake tube"" which is a device used in turkey hunting to duplicate turkey calls.

While attending to his business in almost complete darkness he smelled what he described as an overwhelming odor like that of a ‘hog pen’. Curious, Mr. B reached into his car and turned on the headlights to his vehicle. Right away Mr. B saw a 7’-8’ tall creature with 3”-4” inch muddy and matted hair looking back at him from 30 yards away, standing in the middle of the road directly in his headlights. -Mr. B stated that the muddy brown haired creature had red tints to its hair and that it was un-kept looking and was coated with mud on its legs and lower torso.

Mr. B gave me a description of what the creature looked like. It had wide and sloping, or ‘slouched’ shoulders, its arms hung down to its mid calf. Although the creature was holding its arms out when he first spotted it, the creature lowered its arms and Mr. B could not get a good look at its hands. Mr. B didn’t see any teeth but commented that its mouth, or jaw, did not protrude, but that the mouth was 'large'. Mr. B stated that its nose was short and that its nostrils were ‘big’ and flared. He described the head as being shaped like an ‘ape’s head’ but more rounded off. And that its eyes did not glow, but looked large and dark. -After looking at each other in silence for approximately one minute the creature resumed its walk towards the left side of the road and disappeared into the adjacent woods. Mr. B describes its gait as being similar to a man except that its stride was longer. Its posture remained upright during the entire episode. -Mr. B was adamant that he never felt threatened by the creature, even though it was only 30 yards away from him. He also made comment that the area is very rural and that it was only a mile or so from the Saline River. -As stated in the report, Mr. B did go to the sight the next day to look for tracks. But it had rained several times since his sighting and he could not find anything usable. -I found Mr. B to be articulate, truthful and matter of fact. -In doing a Google search from the area and questioning Mr. B, this area is very remote from any nearby houses.

We drove to a spot that we had just found a few days before. We parked are truck up on top of a ridge and hiked down a draw that leads into a canyon. I started down to a sidehill above the draw while my dad and brother headed down the draw. After being seperate from each other for about 15 minutes I was up above the draw a ways, and I was standing there looking around the hillsides when I heard a kind of moaning howling sound which to me at that time sounded like a man yelling ""help""very slowly and weakly like they were hurt. So I started to head back down into the draw to make sure it wasnt someone needing help. About 30 seconds went by and I heard it again so I stopped to listen I heard it a little louder this time since I was farther down the draw. This time I had a very weird feeling go through me I felt uneasy and almost a scared sensation but I still thought it was someone yelling ""help"". I eventually met up whith my dad and brother and asked if they had heard that yelling sound they said yes and that it was very close to them which they thought sounded more like an angry moaning sound and then heard a pop about as loud as a 22 rifle but it wasnt a rifle. So we made are way down to the bottom of the draw where the sound had come from, we came to a barbed wire fence around which the ground all around had been torn up quit a bit and the top strand of wire had been broken in half; which we looked at and could tell it was a fresh break-- we couldnt find any tracks that we could identify. We figured it was a buck or bull that got its horns stuck in the wire and had made the sound that we heard we had never known of them making this sound but what else could it have been we figured. So we finished the day hunting. The next morning we went to the same spot and about an hour into the hunt we came across a large foot print in a cow pie all the print was there except the toes which were off the cow pie it was then that we come to the conclusion that we must have heard the day before whatever left this foot print.The track was about 12 inches without the toes and around 6 inches wide.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ohio Howl,yes,1 knock,1,NA,100,12,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,"The witness was very credible, and knowledgeable, and easily recalled the events.

It was sunset, I ran him up the fairly short distance to the highest switchback and turned off the ATV, walking a hundred yards or so to give him privacy. It started getting dark (it gets dark and cold that high up real fast) and I began meandering back to hopefully hurry him up. As I approached a cluster of trees right up against the switchback on the uphill side, there was the deepest growl I've ever heard - in a warning manner. At first I thought it was a cat, but it was much deeper in resonance. Thinking this would be a short trip, I left my rifle and shotgun at camp, and only had my 1911 sidearm on me, and I wasted no time in shucking it. I was fearful for Steve, as this thing was between me and Steve who was unaware of any threat, so I slid-walked toward Steve, both arms extended at ready-fire. I peered as closely as I could, but could see nothing due to the tree cluster and twilight. As I finally slid-walked past the cluster and was now between the previously unaware Steve, I chanced a quick look over my right shoulder to see if Steve had noted anything yet. He had, and had also shucked his pistol, with the phone in the other hand, clearly getting off. As my head was turning back toward the low growling in the tree cluster, halfway, I was stunned to see an absolutely massive, huge, very tall creature hurrying toward the tree cluster. It actually had to slide past me to get to the cluster, so it wasn't threatening me. It reached the cluster and I heard no further noise, steadily backing up. Had there been a cat in those trees, there surely would have been quite a ruckus, but things went silent. I recall very clearly being not stunned by its size, but how fast it was and how quickly it covered ground. I remember thinking, 'this thing could run down a deer.' From Steve's angle, he couldn't see it, but the thing had to run across some thirty yards of knee high (to me) growth, so I got a good look at this thing. I reached the ATV and said, ""we're leaving."" In retrospect, after replaying this a hundred times again and again, I feel that there was either a female or juvenile in the trees, and was surprised when I approached, and growled to warn me off. This is entirely speculative, but I feel confident that the huge adult was hustling over to the tree cluster to tell the other one to 'knock it off.' The .45ACP is a very effective anti-personnel round up close. However, when I saw the sheer mass, if this thing wanted me dead, as big and as fast as he was, he'd have had me. Steve found another location to make phone calls after that which was much closer to the camp.

He explained that this was the first time he had ever seen anything like this and that he was still in disbelief. While the incident had occurred at least a year prior, the witness described the vivid imagery that still plagued his memory. Having served as a career Special Forces soldier in the Viet Nam conflict with extensive decorations, the witness related that he was an avid tracker, hunter, and all-around outdoorsman. He said his military occupation was “manhunter,” but he had never seen such a creature. While the vocalizations at first gave him the impression he was dealing with a large cat, he described that once he saw the subject, it was at least 2.5 meters tall, having shoulders “twice as wide as any man,” and dark, muddy brown, almost black, longer hair with a “cream-colored” face. His military technical jargon and vernacular were present during our conversation. In retelling the encounter, he detailed how the creature at first “growled” which appeared to be from a distance in the tree cluster, but the vibratory sensation and sonic impact felt as if the animal were standing next to him. In the ensuing moments, he saw the creature come between him and his friend and he said panic began to set in, mainly because he felt his sidearm would have been useless had the creature decided to attack himself or his friend. The witness repeatedly emphasized the girth of the animal’s legs, and the rapidity of movement, as apparently the creature was also in some sort of panic mode. The witness mentioned that the lodging he had taken during his stay in the area was staffed by a couple who were very familiar with the presence of large upright bipedal animals in the location of his encounter. I subsequently visited and interviewed the couple. They explained that the witness stayed in their inn along with Steve, as well as several other miners for the duration of their mineral exploration. The couple told me of two other encounters as recently as July 2012 by miners who stayed in their inn. Then they took me to the location of the witnesses encounter, high in the surrounding hills. While we accessed the location of the encounter via ATV late in the afternoon, one of the innkeepers spotted a ""dark figure"" on the ridge across from the switchback, in a clearing on a rocky outcrop. We attempted to spot the figure again via binoculars and 9x scope without success. This location is steep, not accessible unless by the most robust of vehicles, and known for mysterious vocalizations and sightings. All details from the innkeepers correlated with the witnesses description of the events. Since the town has an extensive mining history, there is also associated lore describing ""monsters"" in the hills.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=36076

Around dusk, they decided to return to camp. While proceeding down a trail towards their camp they found their path blocked by a large log which had been moved across the trail. As they had sped up and down this particular trail many times during the preceding hours, they were certin that this log had been placed there in the late afternoon.Because of the log's size, they did not attempt to move it out of the trail, but with great difficulty, managed to get their dirt bikes around it.

My husband was leading me along the trail and he did not hear this sound. I stopped him and described the sound to him as a sort of ""wild boar"" type sound. It was VERY hard to describe. The sound was low, deep, like a vibrating growl or snort. We looked around and listened. When we didn't hear anything for quite a few minutes, we began walking again. Not more than 3 or 4 steps down the trail we hear a rustle noise and I quickly turned to see a rock or something rather large, dark and round fall to the ground with a large THUMP! The item had landed just where I was standing only a moment before. My husband heard this large item hit the ground and we stood stunned for a moment trying to figure out where it came from. I looked around the area and found a rock about the size of a baseball sitting where the item had hit the ground. My husband and I could NOT figure out where it had come from. Was a rock in the tree and it just now fell? Did something throw that rock at us? We were a bit jumpy but kept on down the trail. About 1/4 mile along the trail we hear a loud ""whomp, whomp"" like wood against wood sound ahead of us up on the hill. I asked my husband what that was and he decided it was probably just some people doing work on the trail. I didn't believe that's what it was. It sounded too heavy to be man made. Maybe machinery, but there was no motor sound and it was a Sunday evening. I doubt workers were on duty at this time and on this day. Just then we heard the sound move and we turned to hear the same wood on wood ""whomp"" noise behind us on the trail and still above us on the hill. My husband remarked, ""If that was bigfoot I don't know how he moved that quickly!"" I told him that we could rule out trail workers and that it was quite possible that it was TWO bigfoot communicating with each other. We joked about it, but we were both very shaken. We just could not come up with a more reasonable explanation for this sound. My husband describes this sound as a person hitting a tree quite hard with a large log. After yet another few minutes of looking around and hoping to see something, we walked along the trail without answers. After this we heard nothing more and came across several hikers on the last mile of the trail. Several hikers had dogs and we didn't hear any dogs going wild barking at anything unusual. My husband and I were going to stop some hikers to ask if they had heard anything, but we didn't want to look crazy or scare them away from the trail. Other than the rock being thrown at us we didn't feel as though we were in any kind of danger. When I got home I called my father who is quite familiar with forest animals and noises. He couldn't explain where the rock would have come from, but he believes that the wood on wood sound could possibly be deer or elk. I doubt that it was deer or elk just because the trail was so populated. They would have been spooked by the hikers and the dogs... besides, the ""whomp"" sound was SO heavy and SO loud that I can't imagine a deer making such a large sound. We didn't smell anything, we didn't see footprints...but I can't think of anything else that would explain these noises and the rock being thrown at us.

About half way through our hike, we heard a UAS (Unidentified Animal Sound). The best way I can describe it is to say that it was a short, deep, guttural whooping sound. Whatever it was, was clearly rather too close for our liking. We weren't really frightened, but we were unnerved enough to take safety precautions. I stopped taking pictures, and Travis & I insisted that the kids walk between us in a tight group for the remainder of the hike. The sound came and went, and at one point it became clear that there were at least two of whatever-they-were, because we realized that not all of the sounds were coming from the same direction. They were alternating, as if they were communicating.

He said at one point it made all the hair on the back of his neck stand up, and that the sound was about 200 yards off the trail, or closer, and the return reply sounded to be about a mile off, and would get closer, and farther. He said the impressive thing that really stood out was that it was obivious they were communicating, and it fascinated him that they were having a conversation, if you will, while moving through the forest.

There was a trail that was used by kids in the area to get down into the woods and a little way off the trail, my brother and I had hauled a little wood and built a little platform about six feet up in the crook of a tree. That day, around noon, we were in that platform, shooting our BB gun at a tall stump that was just a little ways down hill from where we were. My brother turned around as I was preparing to fire and just as I was ready to shoot the BB gun, something with a human-like head passed right in front of the tall stump. The trees and brush obscured everything but the head, but I got a good look at it. It had brown fur over almost all of the head, but not dark brown, just a little darker than cinnamon color, a kind of flat nose and the hair/fur was not too long. It walked by and disappeared into the brush almost without making a sound (there was a very heavy bed of needles from the Douglas Fir all over), it happened so suddenly and so fast that I didn't have a chance to get scared. I called my brother's name and he turned in time to see some of the branches still swaying. We stood there and talked about it for a few minutes and then carefully went down to where it passed in front of me and figured that it had to have been about 7 1/2 feet tall. After this, I went to my former eighth grade science teacher who happened to live in the neighborhood (this was a town of about 1,200 at the time) and told him about it. He was very skeptical and gave me numerous things that he thought I'd seen. He obviously didn't believe I had seen a Sasquatch/Bigfoot. Later that same day, around dusk, my brother and I were sitting on the trail, not too far from the ""tree fort"" that I had seen it from earlier in the day, talking about it. Suddenly, I'm not sure what made him do it, but he looked over at the platform that we had built (about 20 to 30 yards away) and his face turned white as a ghost. I looked over there and saw a sillouette of a""man"" looking at us (head and shoulders) from behind our tree fort. Since it was dusk, we weren't able to make out any features, just the outline. Also, we both jumped up and ran the rest of the way home, scared half out of our wits. The second sighting we had that day, the creature didn't seem anything but curious about us, but it still scared us. Also, two years later, I was down in the woods at almost midnight (I'd left something down there the previous day) and heard footsteps coming towards me and a huffing noise, almost like a horse blowing.

The animal seemed to be following my sent directly to where I was hidden in some blackberry bushes. A cover scent had been applied to my clothes and boots using pine needles that were blended with water. My clothes were soaked in the solution and dried -- very effective ... for deer anyway.

I hope you don't take my report as bogus because of that. Let me explain my situation to you: I live, and have lived, on the Molalla river for most of my life and never thought twice about walking around at night or anywhere period. About 2 months ago, I was alone in my Grandmas house using the computer, when I decided to go home (my house is only about 50 yards away). As I was stepping outside the most hideous feeling of being alone and fear thumped my heart. I kept walking in terror, when all of the sudden about 30 feet off to my right, I heard a loud thumping sound crash out. From there on, being distorted by my act of running faster than I've ever moved before, I could swear I heard the distinctive two-legged footsteps veering toward me from off the trail between houses. I raced in my house, slammed the door, locked it and sat in the living room to calm down from my strange experience.The oddest feelings flushed through me then, and now. Now, before you dismiss my story as a frightened child running from noises, I'll have to tell you of the strange past our 45 acres of land at the end of the Dickey Prairie road has had: Around three years ago, when we had cattle and cows fenced on our property, I noticed casually how they would always stay together and go near the barns at night. Then one day we discovered two of them killed up in the woods by the drinking creek. The killings weren't average killings either. The cows didn't have a scratch on them, both had broken necks and their eyeballs sucked cleanly out. Since those experiences, I'm now scared to go hiking and travel at night. Yes, average signs of fear, but I have the weird feeling of being an 'Intruder'. Thank you for your time sincerely, Shawn Murray p.s.

At the time this happened, there was a musky smell in the area. He also told me of other incidents. One, about a year before this, when something frightened his younger brother while the two of them were hunting on their property. His brother maintains that what he saw was a young sasquatch, Shawn told me he didn't get a clear view. Another involved something getting into their garbage. The refuse was placed in a trailer and covered with a tarp, which was then weighted down with blocks of wood. In order to get into it, something had strewn the wood 15-25 ft. from the trailer and rolled back the tarp. Ripped open bags were found in a field on the property.

I am mainly putting it on here because I have thought about it in depth (that's why the delay in reporting), and the only thing in my memory that has any resemblance at all to what I've heard is the past audio recordings of bigfoot (although what I heard had better audio!). I still wonder if this was a bigfoot, how or why it would have been near a town, but I have no other explanations. I was in Sandy, Oregon with my family during the weekend of July 21-23, 2000. We were staying at the Sandy Inn, which is just west of the main part of town. It was hard to sleep the night of the 21st; it was very humid and some thunderstorms did move through about midnight or so. I was up several times during the night; either to shut the window, open the window, turn on the air conditioning, etc. I got up once around 3 or so in the morning on the 22nd after the storms passed. I was sticking my head out of our 2nd story window, enjoying some cool air and kind of looking off into the woods toward the north. There was not a sound anywhere (that I could hear). No cars on the highway, nothing. Then I heard a very indescribable sound. I thought at first it was tires screeching but as the seconds passed I realized a car would have to be burning rubber for a long ways. Then as I kinda cleared my head, I thought it sounded like a man screaming, or better yet, wailing. But I've n ever heard a human do a sound like that either. It was not a moan or howling with an ""o"" sound, it was more like ""eye-eeee--ah-eye-eee"". Very high pitched. It won't do me much good to try to interpret the sound in letters. But the way the pitch of the sound went up and down so fast, I've never heard any animal or human do that, and I've heard quite a lot of animals. If a a human did what I heard, they'd bust their vocal chords. It went on for about 20 seconds-maybe a little longer, but not sure of that. It did seem to kind of trail off at one point then come back. I know it was long enough for me to get a good listen. It was not close by, either. The window faced toward the north, so it's possible that's where it came from but I can't be sure of that. It seemed like it was off in the distance somewhere. When it started, it was rather quiet, and ended trailing off in the same manner it started. Even though I was a bit groggy, it was wierd enough to wake me up and even scare me a bit. I didn't think too much of it at the time but the next morning I was thinking to myself, ""What was that?"" I didn't report it or consider that until now because I wasn't sure and after a while I honestly had forgotten about it until something in my mind triggered it again.

We did not disturb the one we took detailed pictures of but we dug around a little in the others looking for hair but we did not find anything. There was nothing that I saw that indicated that the aminal might still be around. But then again there was nothing I could point to that would indicate that he was gone either. We looked to find where he had gotten on the path and where he had left it but could not find anything. It is possible that he came from the Table Rock trail itself and so did not leave deep tracks that could be seen. Hope this has been helpful. If you have any other questions I will try to answer. Let me know if you find anything else. And if I find anything else you will be the first to know."" Results of follow-up investigation: On 3/20/01 I visited the location of the track find on Table Rock Creek in the Mt. Hood Nation Forest southeast of Molalla, Oregon. Precisely as the witness described, I found widely spaced bare-foot prints that measured 14"" long and were spaced an average of 48"" apart (from heel of one foot to same spot on heel of the opposing foot). I measured strides of 112"" between heel impressions of the SAME foot in two places. I counted twenty four prints in all. The tracks were beside a trail in the snow that follows a road bed to the Table Rock trailhead. Auto traffic is cut off by collapse of the roadway but snowshoe prints and boot prints were evident all along the road. The path along the road bed leaves the parking area as bare earth but gradually turns to completely snow covered. Snow depth at the track location, which is about one mile from the parking area, is about 18"". Several factors raise suspicion about the tracks: The tracks are close to other human tracks. The foot length is 14"", which could be a human with size 14-15 feet. The most impressive aspect of the tracks is the long stride between steps. Still, I was able to duplicate the long stride with running leaps. I'm 6ft. tall. Though fakery cannot be ruled out, it is also possible that a hiker removed his shoes for whatever reason and ran in the snow in bare or stocking feet for some twenty-four steps. The footprints looked to be made from bare, not stocking feet. Toe detail on some prints seemed to be too clear for stocking feet. On the other hand, the location is remote, the snow is deep, the elevation is high, and it therefore seems much less likely that a very large, barefoot person would be running through deep snow to leave these impressions for us to find. If the same tracks were found nearer to frequently traveled tourist locations, I would be more suspicious about their origin. After visiting the site and viewing the tracks, I was able to resolve some of the concerns raised by Rick. The tracks measued at a full 14 inches, maybe a bit more. Stride was considerable: 48"" between same points in opposing feet and up to 112"" between same points in same foot. Snow was 18"" deep at the track site. Tracks penetrated 12"" deep on average. The stretch of the trail with the tracks is north facing and preservation of the tracks has been aided by the lack of sun that strikes the snow in that shaded portion of the roadway. While it is possible that a hiker removed his shoes and socks and took about twenty steps off the trail in the deep snow, the stride is too long for comfortable human strides. I was able to match the stride by running on the trail beside the prints and virtually leaping between steps. It would be exhausting to accomplish this in bare feet and in the deep snow at the 3500 foot elevation, but it is clearly *possible* for a determined person with large feet to have made these tracks. Therefore, it seems unlikely to me that someone would go to this trouble in such a remote place. Further, I saw several other possible barefoot tracks in other places along the trail, but greater sun exposure deteriorated them to the point where nothing can be determined for certain. The tracks that were clearly evident looked to be about one week old. The last heavy mountain snow was 3/14-3/16. My guess is that the tracks were made right after this, before the snow developed the stiff crust from sun exposure that it has now. I favor the view that the tracks are genuine sasquatch tracks. If genuine, why would the tracks be there? Perhaps a bigfoot was travelling down Table Rock Creek toward the warmer forested lowlands along the Molalla River. Or, could it be a resident sasquatch roaming it's home range? Either way, the compacted snow of the Table Rock trail provides much easier travelling than trekking across deep and trackless snow. The many boot prints on the trail also offers a means to travel without leaving discernible tracks if an animal wished to conceal its passing. Some of us favor the view that bigfoots make efforts to conceal their movements whenever possible. The numerous boot prints on the compacted snow trail would make recognition of individual tracks difficult. So, why then, would one of these animals step out of the packed snow of the trail and leave these conspicuous tracks? From the size of the feet and the look of the track run, I envision an older juvenile or young adult that stepped out of the trail but soon found the going to be strenuous and returned to the trail. Speculation might include a strong-willed adolescent or two individuals sharing a narrow trail and jockeying for position. In any case, the Molalla River area and specifically the Table Rock Creek locality has historic bigfoot activity extending over many years. Some field researchers consider it to be a hotbed of bigfoot activity. While investigating the site at 5pm on 3/20/01, I did some elk calls and other animal calls. After doing my call, I heard two animal noises that I could not identify. The first was a single, shrill, loud scream. The other unfamiliar sound was a low ""whump-whump-whump-whump-whump-whump"" sound that quickened as it repeated seven times. it repeated several times and I taped it on my camcorder. I thought of a grouse drumming but this noise was slower than the quick ""thumpa-thumpa-thumpa-thumpa-thump"" of grouse durmming that I'm familiar with. -Thom Powell",NA,yes,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=1986

The occupants of the car where not identified or contacted, but did stop a short distance from the creature, insinuating that the driver also observed the sighting. The creature was running fast, upright, very hairy, humanoid in appearance, and estimated to be 7 feet tall (definitely larger than the witness who is 6’3”). The local dogs were barking excitably, which is why the witness looked out the window. A search for footprints with flashlights was unsuccessful for finding clues or footprints.

The family dog, a large protective crossbreed was outside chained up to his runner. The dog started to bark and the other neighbors dogs barked as well, which is considered normal. However, the barking increased more excitably, enough so for Ben to take notice. Looking out the north-facing window in the Living room, Ben saw an approaching automobile driving towards him down his road approaching HWY. #26. He then saw the creature run from left to right across his road, backlit by the approaching car. The car slowed, and Ben felt that the occupant(s) of the car saw the creature as well, enough so to slow down almost to a stop. The car and occupants continued and are unknown. The view is partially blocked by trees but Ben was sure of what he saw. After telling his sister she decided to leave for her mother's work around the corner while Ben went to the back door to get the dog inside. The dog was still curious and didn't initially want to come in. Ben noticed a ""bad"" smell outside, and got the dog inside. I was originally told of the possible bigfoot sighting at approximatly10:30 PM by the witness's Mother at her work a quarter mile from the sighting. The witness's 20-year-old sister was also present at the mother's workplace and was obviously distressed by her brothers sighting. I arrived at the Witness's home at 11:00 PM to meet and interview the witness Ben Stites (18 years old). I initially asked what Ben saw and he excitably explained he saw what he thought to be a Bigfoot. I asked why he thought so, and he described the following; ""creature was large - about 7 feet tall, very hairy, ran upright very fast across the road."" He wasn't sure what it was but didn't think it was a bear. Bear sightings were reported in the immediate area during September and early October. He asked me if I thought it might have been a bear and I responded that I don't think bears run very fast standing upright, which he emphasized. Ben seemed to be forthright and brief in his experience; further emphasizing he was being honest and not embellishing. I asked Ben if he would show me where he saw the creature and he agreed. His sister, who was now home too, asked if we should bring the baseball bat, which was lying on the coach in the living room? I took this to be evidence of concern at the time. We didn't take any weapons. We left his home by the front door with flash lights, walked to the road and turned right and walked approximately 100 feet to where the creature was seen. Ben's road is narrow, with few neighbors in a forested area. While walking to the seen Ben was noticeably excited and kept looking around. By checking back at the angle of his home he identified the crossing point, approximately 30 feet shy of the next two driveways on either side of the road. Approximately 130 feet from the window he viewed the creature. A very small building similar to an entry post of a military entrance at the neighbors’ driveway helped Ben to identify the sighting location. I tried to see with my flashlight if any footprints existed at the edge of the road on both sides and up both driveways. Being careful of our steps, no footprints of any kind were seen. The edge of the road was muddy. The forest among the houses in the area has lower brush and foliage, including many ferns. Several ferns were noticeably broken at the roads edge but couldn't be identified as ""fresh."" After estimating distances and locations, we returned to Ben's home. It is my opinion than Ben saw what was described above. Ben does not have a history of embellishing stories, although teenagers are probably more demographically probable of making up stories for attention. -Rob Gracie",yes,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=3441

Nevertheless, she could only see the mesmerizing, slanted eyes staring at her with a bare indication of a hairy head and the large body hidden in the darkness. After the bang on the door, she heard what amounted to a very deep ""purring"" sound, a soft growl. She saw the eyes after an initial first look out of the window, closed the blinds, but subsequently pulled them aside and looked at the animal for an estimated 10 minutes, the animal not moving and barely blinking its eyes.

It was around midnight when I noticed strange noises in the treeline approx. 100 yards from his house. These noises were birdlike in nature and seemed to be coming from 3 places, directly in front of the house and off to both sides and further away. These noises sounded like birds but were only part of a bird call, and they seemed to be answering each other. There were 5 different noises and while they seemed birdlike they definitely came from something larger than a bird. At approx. 12:30 am I finally asked the other people at the house to come outside and listen. Everyone agreed that the noises were strange and like nothing they had ever heard before. We shined a flashlight in the area that noises seemed closest and saw nothing due to heavy brush, but the noises quit in that area until we stopped shining the light. These noises lasted until approx. a half an hour until dawn and quit quite suddenly. I grew up in the area and spend alot of time hunting and fishing and being in the outdoors, as does the property owner, we could not identify any local animal that makes these noises. In the morning we went and looked in the area closest to the house and found want could 2 possible tracks, they matched nothing we had ever seen, and we compared them with the other animal tracks in the area and they matched nothing, also noticed that the grass was pushed down in approx 3-4 foot strides running through the field behind the stream area where we found the possible tracks and where we thought some the noises were coming from. Since then the property owner has heard the same noises at night and last night heard something thrashing around in the brush.

Unfortunately, when we got to our destination, I was the only one in our group that wanted to look for Bigfoot. Disappointed but not dissuaded, I tried to keep the rest of the group (2 guys and 1 girl) at least somewhat interested in the Bigfoot search, to little avail. The first night we camped (under much protest) quite a way into the bush and away from the overcrowded camp grounds where everyone felt more comfortable. We followed an old logging road until it ended at a very secluded spot atop a ridge and maybe 250 to 350 yards directly south of the clear cut power line running east/west. The first night was interesting as we continued to hear distinct wood knocking; they started at around 11:00pm. Most were far off and very fast, 4 to 7 quick, sharp cracks directly east of us that would echo across the valley only to be answered from another direction farther south and then north but at first they were pretty far off. Everyone thought they were gunshots but this was a really dark night and these sounds were coming from pretty deep in the thick forest accessed only by not well traveled logging roads and from at least 3 different sources that for the life of me, sounded like they were communicating so I ruled out gunshots. These sounds continued to get closer to our campsite as the night wore on. At one point, maybe 12:30 or 1:00am the group wanted to drive over to the power lines, where the trees weren’t so thick and you could see for several miles, I decided to stay at camp and hope for something to happen. Almost immediately after everyone left, I started hearing sticks breaking from the direction they had driven out on and everything got real quiet. Now I’m from Montana and have spent many a night camped alone in far more rugged mountains than I was in now and have experienced most of the wildlife at least partially up close and personal that our American forests have to offer but I gotta tell you, I got a little spooked while they were gone! I did what any self respecting outdoors man would do and…put a lot more wood on the fire! I didn’t hear anything at that time that sounded too bizarre but I was glad when everyone got back. My buddy asked me if I was knocking rocks together while they were gone. I told him I hadn’t and asked what they heard. He said that they were out looking at the valley from the top of the road we came in on, about 250 to 350yards away and they all heard distinct knocking coming from the direction of our camp, he said it sounded like rock on rock. Later after everyone had gone to their tents I again decided to stay up. At around 3:30am I heard a very low grumble with a huff followed by what sounded like a lot of breath being pushed out and very close to the fire, maybe 30ft. At first I thought it was a bird or something, then, almost immediately another answered the first from across the clearing we were camped in directly behind me. I put my flashlight on where I heard the sound coming from and it would stop. 10 min later it would start up again. I don’t know why I didn’t get anyone up to listen with me but I didn’t. This went on for about an hour, until the sun started to brighten the sky and you could see a lot better. I never heard walking or anymore sticks breaking but those grunting noises were definitely close and there was at least 2 of whatever was making them. It wasn’t until on our way home that my buddy told me that he had heard the grunts too and, I love this, he was too scared to get up and investigate. The next day we went looking for another campground. I didn’t want to leave but I was definitely the minority on the subject. As we were driving down, I believe was FR43, my buddy and I in his rig and his friends behind us in theirs, something very big ran across the road about 150yrds in front of us. It was dark brown or black and uniform in color and at least 8ft to 9ft tall and moving like a freight train, it was huge! We only saw it for maybe a second before it tore into the trees running from the right to the left. My skeptical buddy looked at me and said “Did you see that!” I had my video camera in my lap but there was no way I could have gotten a shot of this thing, it was really moving! We stopped where we thought it crossed the road and you could see quite clearly where something had came down the incline on the right side of the road, we didn't smell anything. We got out and I climbed the small incline that it had come down to investigate and after 30 min or so found a barefoot track 18” long x 7½” wide and got video of it. I can send you the video and have other stories of the area as well. We did have material to cast the print but since it was in the mossy ground that covers most of the Oregon forest my buddy refused to cast the print claiming that we wouldn’t get anything from it. I was furious but it was his stuff and I learned the hard way to pack your own gear! when i climbed the incline after we saw the thing cross the road, something tore off away from me which would have been heading south west into the forest when i peaked the incline. very noisy! Also, the track I found was definitely older, i don't think it was made at the time of the sighting.

Now I KNOW,..... August 25, 2009 my girlfriend, her two boys and I went camping at my usual spot. This location was picked due to the isolation factor; it's 10 miles up logging roads near Estacada, Oregon. I will not disclose the GPS cords. or even close to prox., This is MY spot. Nothing abnormal occured over the day or night of the 24th, and the day of the 25th was normal events like gathering wood for the coming night. We had put the boys down for the night just after sun down. We were hanging around the fire chatting and poking the fire. Being who I am, I began making noise to hear it echo through the trees. You know, rooster noises and some whooping, basic idiot noises (approx. 1130 pm). I do this at times to keep bigger game from coming through camp. Well, I got one hell of a shock about 15 minutes later. We were walking back toward the fire from the truck, the fire was only bright glowing coals at this point, and BOOM, shock to the system!!!! Out of the pitch black night....one of the most unreal sounds I've ever heard in my life came rushing through the dark. It was a hair stiffening scream that at that moment I couldn't match in my memory of noises over the 20 years I've been going into nature to escape. This was the first time in my life that I felt a need to get out of nature, QUICKLY. The sound pushed through the trees like the trees were not even there. Even the air around us seemed to vibrate. From experience I have had in the woods through my life, and tracking sounds and distance, I'm estimating that this scream was being produced about 200 yards away. It was so loud that nothing I know of could make this big of a noise. There is no animal I have come accross that has the lungs to produce such a loud, long and vocalized sound as this ""creature"" produced. Let me put it this way....if someone told me they heard it, I would be trying to put a K9 responsible, but hearing it myself and knowing of nothing I've ever encountered could make that sound. Now, I did not stand there much longer. I think I may have pushed my girlfriend up into the truck so I could get in ASAP. As soon as I was in, the lights were on and the horn going for about 3 seconds to try to keep it from getting closer. It seemed to work because the volume started to fade a bit. We decided to get camp up and get out. over the minutes it took us to completely tear down camp, maintain a track on movement of the screams and shove camp into the truck, the screamig continued and moved. From the time it started ,it was at 2 o'clock from the camp. While we were packing up, it moved clockwise around to about 5 o'clock from camp. This all took about 30 minutes before we were on our way down hill. The screams continued even on our way out. To make it completely clear, I've done alot in my life.

It sounded otherworldly and struck fear into us instantly. We froze in terror and listened for about 30 seconds as the screaming whoops got louder and closer-sounding. Then we ran to the truck and honked the horn like crazy. The sounds continued and we sat listening for a good ten minutes as the sounds continued but seemed to move further away. We exited the truck and tore down camp immediately, pausing every few minutes to monitor the distance of the sounds, jumping into the truck for a minute or so again when the sounds would get close, honking the horn occasionally for good measure.

One of the accounts he described on the phone was a camping trip at the same location some months prior where he heard what he believed to be ""a bigfoot hollering."" He then went on to describe this most recent weekend camping trip to the lake, accompanied by a couple of male friends with specific intent of baiting the creature with a 55 gallon barrel of slaughterhouse by-products consisting of goat and beef entrails as well as a sheepskin with head intact. Having left the barrel in the back of his truck, the gentlemen proceeded to wind down for their first night of camp. Very soon up on the ridge, 100 yards north of the campsite, loud indecipherable vocalizations not attributable to bear or other known wild animals, began to emanate from the top of the ridge along with tree breaking and ""stomping."" The next day very early from inside their tents, all three men heard more vocalizations and even closer ""stomping."" When preparing breakfast, the party noticed that their plastic top metal-framed camp table appeared to have been bitten through. See photo: They decided at that point to dump the guts away from camp, as they were beginning to fear for their safety. Subsequent trips to the ""gut pile"" revealed most of the bait to be missing. After carefully reviewing the account of the witness, I decided to visit the location myself and spent three consecutive nights there in the latter days of July 2013. My campsite was approximately 75 yards from his location. The first night there I went to a very high ridge approximately 1.25 miles away and performed several tree knocks and blasted some short ""whoop"" calls myself - both exercises yielded no apparent response. I made my way back to my camp, energized a vehicle-affixed FLIR PathFindIR, and positioned my tripod-mounted parabolic audio recorder facing the ridge where the witness heard the night vocalizations and activity approx 175 yards away. My tent, and the tent where my young sons and their 13 year-old companion had bedded down, were in between the audio array and the ridge above. I turned in at about midnight. At approximately 2:35 AM, according to the audio recorder time stamp, the attached audio of tree fall and associated forest floor movement was recorded. The following morning, I spoke with several other campers in the campground and all remarked on the “boom” heard during the night. * Recording * The next day I investigated the area from where the tree fall crash appeared to occur. Indeed there was a very large apparently healthy fir approximately 12 inches in diameter and 70 feet in height, freshly downed with the top of the tree pointing in the direction of my campsite. The roots were still intact to the trunk, and it appeared that it had been pushed down. The tree trunk and roots, and gaping hole in the ground, were approximately three feet from another apparently healthy tree that was still standing, and that tree had what appeared to be hair caught in the bark at about 6 foot from the ground on the same side facing the felled tree. The remaining two nights of my stay transpired uneventfully. Thermal video data was analyzed, and the limited range of the camera prevented the capture of heat signatures to further analyze the tree-felling event. After speaking with the witness upon my return, I found his entire series of events to be corollary to my own experience and determined that his accounts were factual to the best of his observational capabilities. Based on the combined data gathered from all of the events, as well as a rich history of bigfoot reports from the area, I concluded that there was a high likelihood that the events in that location during last weeks of July 2013 were attributable to bigfoot activity.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=41709

Their campsite was located close to a path that lead to the river and was next door to one of the campground comfort stations. There was only one other campsite occupied in the campground, also a couple, and it was on the other side of the campground about 60-70 yards away. The witness related having been awakened at approx 5AM by the very loud, very close, ""human-sounding"" groans. He described the sound as ""almost human"" but so deep and loud that that the sound vibrated his diaphragm. His girlfriend was awake and asked him if he had heard the ""three grunts"" and he knew instantly that he was not dreaming, and that it was not a figment of his imagination. The witness remarked that his experience with bear raiding a campsite usually involved rifling through the cooking gear, and in this case, there were pots and pans as well as plates with food residue still on them left out on the picnic table that were not disturbed in any way. Also, he could not visualize a bear grunting in such a way to have heard it 2 feet above the ceiling of his 6-1/2 ft tent from a distance of about 6-7 feet from the back wall of the tent. The witness described himself as a 51 year-old CPA professional and his companion as 48 years old.

With numerous rock quarries used to create the logging roads, at times the shooters make the canyons sound like a war zone. But as soon as playtime is over and evening sets in, people head back down the hill and the war zone transforms into a more serene and mysterious place. Booms and blasts are replaced with the sounds of the wind blowing through the firs, birds chirping and camp conversations. When night falls, another reality becomes quickly apparent. This area has one of the highest instances of Sasquatch encounters in the country. Like many, I have reviewed lots of evidence online and from word of mouth, all the while wrestling with a degree of skepticism. This was not my first experience with this group leader, but it would prove to be my most memorable to date. We arrived at camp somewhere in the 2:30 to 3:00 PM range, set-up and planned for that night’s scouting. As the sun set and dusk turned to dark, the group leader gathered us together. Having sized up the territory and considered several scenarios, he shared his thoughts about that night’s approach. A particularly important point he mentioned was that it was vital to remain flexible, and open to the possibility of modifying our plans if new evidence presented itself. So the initial direction was decided and tactics clarified. He had selected an old closed road farther up the ridge, up against the beginning of the older growth (probably 2nd growth) timber. Access to the road had been blocked years before by a berm, impossible for cars, yet fairly easy to traverse on foot. It was roughly midnight as we crossed the berm into what can only be described, based on everyone’s sudden change of mood, as “someone or something else’s world”. The wind had finally all but stopped and it was now deathly quiet, except for the crunching of rocks under our boots. The brightness of the waxing moon lit the landscape and our company in shadowy shades of black and grey, with silvery highlights. Our shadows were black and well defined. One gentleman of our five-man team, a young veteran of a middle-east war, proudly clad in his fatigues, walked point, followed by the group leader and his son. I was next, having made sure to place myself as close to the middle of the company as possible, and finally, the oldest man in our group picked up the rear of the column. I think that older gentleman understood the value of being last, increasing the chance of being selected for contact. The old road cut across a slope near the top of the ridge. Below, a steep drop-off, choked with new growth, rhododendron and an assortment of other lush Western Oregon varieties of undergrowth. Above us, a dark shadowy stand of old trees, with silvery snags strewn throughout the forest floor; the wildest, most rugged terrain this area offers. We approached a large dead tree that had fallen across the road. As each in the company climbed over the log, signaling yet another barrier into another world, the group leader stopped. He had been carrying a tree knocker and now he would put it to good use. It was time to announce our presence. The group leader let loose with two sequences of knocks– “pop pop… pop, then pop, pop”. Each hit echoed through the forest and rebounded off the steep canyons with the force of a home-run. We all had enough experience to stay completely quiet and wait for a possible response. No crunching boots, no wind, dead silence. After a couple of minutes, we moved on. The older gentleman was the first to hear a response - a soft ""tap-tap."" He stopped the group for a listen. The first contact had been paralleling us from below, down the hill in the thick brush. We stopped and listened, nothing, then continued on. I began nervously glancing back down the road behind our column. I couldn’t help but wonder if I might catch a brief glimpse of a dark figure slipping quietly across the road back up into the timber. We then came to a bend in the road. There was a wide turn-out covered with ground cover. Our eyes had continued to adjust, so the moon now lit our position on the landing like a large street light. Just as my mind was focused on all of this, just when I least expected it, the real knocking began. At that moment, reality changed forever and everyone was transformed. All eyes, all thoughts, all senses were now directed toward the dark timber. Not 50 feet away the knocking continued. There among the old trees a shadowy figure, an intelligence controlling a hand, with an opposable thumb, wielding possibly a large stick, sending knocking sounds echoing through the dark cathedral forest. The knocking patterns seemed to be a coded message, letting us know that whoever or whatever it was, knew we were there. The army vet turned to me, I can still remember the excitement in his eyes as he exclaimed: “that’s no woodpecker”, I replied: “this is real!”. I heard my name and quickly turned to see the rest of the group on the ground. The group leader quietly ordered me to get down. There we sat as the group leader exchanged sounds and words with a creature that I now realized for the first time in my life was 100% real and just 50 feet away. Everyone of us felt the rush of being fully and acutely present, alert and alive. During these moments, nothing else seemed to matter. I asked myself, can this really be happening? … It is! The group leader’s words may not have been understood, but his calming tone must have spoken volumes to the figure or figures beyond the tree-line. We felt, as they must have, that neither was there to threaten the other. The knocks were not aggressive, simply a way to let us know they were there. Once the group leader thanked them for allowing us to share their space, he suggested that it might be time to retreat and not push things any further. We began hiking back toward the cars. It soon became apparent that our progress was now being flanked, and so it was, with glowing yellow-green and red eyes, vocalizations, and rustling all the way back to where we had parked. The following night would further reveal why we had been so closely monitored. Once back we were a buzz, we realized that we had all just been transformed, born again.

I was with my dog at the North jetty, in Ft. Stevens State Park. It was a very stormy day and the surf was high, crashing over the rocks on the jetty and pounding the beach. From the viewing tower I saw a man-like figure walk down off the grassy area onto the beach. At first I did not think too much of this ""person"" out on the sands. Then I watched as the figure neared the edge of the water. It was waving its arms up and down facing the surf and the tower. There was another person on the tower with his daughter and they too saw the figure; we looked at each other with a ""what the hell is that"" look but said nothing and continued to watch this figure standing on the beach. At this point I noticed a pick up truck with its lights on approaching up the beach from the south. Then the scale of the figure really struck me; it had to be a good 8 feet tall or more. The figure quickly turned and moved very fast off the beach before the truck was in range. It did not run but rather ""strode"" the 30 or so yards to the dunes edge, then took one or two steps up the embankment and was gone. I was all excited and scared on what I has just seen. I decided to go to the nearest parking lot near where the figure came down on the beach and see if I could get another look at it. As I approached the beach I became even more afraid, the wind was so strong I could hear nothing but the roar of the surf and the howl of the wind through my coat's hood. My dog was anxious and stayed close to me. I went to the beach and found where it came down the sand hill, the sand was all torn up from its passage. But when I discovered the hill was an easy 10 foot high, I really became fearful and decided to return to my car and leave instead of following the tracks into the grass.

In the late afternoon on the second day we were there, a group of five or six of us decided to skateboard on the bike trails between the campground and the Fort. We went to the Fort, walked around and looked, stayed for maybe an hour, and decided to head back to the campground. On the way back, I and one other skated about forty or fifty paces ahead of the others, when we noticed they had stopped. We got off our boards and walked ahead, so the others could catch up with us. We walked around a blind corner on the trail when we heard what sounded like a high pitched scream. My friend said, ""That sounds like a kid."" So we ran down the trail, assuming someone was hurt. While we were running, we heard a series of grunts, very low and very close. They sounded almost like a hog, only longer, and much louder and lower pitched. We stopped running, and I put my hands on my knees and crouched down, looking off the trail all around us to try to see where the sounds were coming from. Then I saw an animal about five feet off the trail, in the brush, approximatly 10 yards away from us, in the direction we had come from. We had run right past it. It was very hairy, and black, and at first glance, I thought it was a black bear(which I've seen before). But then it stood up and I realized it was crouching. The guy I was with was 6'2"", and it was a little taller than him. It swung around and began to run away from the trail into the brush. It ran like a man, much too agile to be a bear, and completely upright, swinging its arms in front of it as it ran to move the heavy brush out of its way. It didn't lumber side to side like a bear does when it stands on its hind legs. I remember being amazed after the incident that it could move so fast. Its speed was really amazing. It took about five very big strides into the brush, and we couldn't see it anymore. We could hear it running through the brush, though. There were a lot of sticks and deadfall on the ground, and the underbrush was pretty thick, so it made a hell of a lot of noise. The sound didn't get very far away from us, and then it just stopped. We ran up to where it had been crouched next to the trail, and stared into the brush for a couple of minutes, but we saw and heard nothing else. Then we got so scared we started running back to where the rest of the party was. The rest of the party laughed at us when we told them the story, so all of us stopped where we had seen the animal. We looked for tracks, or broken undergrowth, but there was so much dead brush on the ground we couldn't even tell where the thing had been crouched in the first place. To this day I remember what the animal looked like, though. It was between 6 and 7 feet tall, and had it been a man, I would have called his weight at about 270. Not great big, but still pretty big. It definitely stood upright like a bipedal animal, and it had pretty long arms with elbow joints. Its legs didn't look all that long, but it had knees, and it ran like a man, but extremely fast. It had black hair which was pretty long. Its back was darker colored than its front. It was late afternoon in early September, the sun was on it, and it was real close to us, so I got a pretty good look at it, however briefly. I can't stress enough how amazingly fast this thing was.

My family and I were vacationing in Seaside, OR and we were staying at Circle Creek RV Park, located on Highway 101 about one mile south of the popular destination town. After being woken up, I listened for some time before getting up and asking my wife if she had heard what I was hearing. She had been sleeping with our two young sons at the opposite end of the trailer. What we both heard for the subsequent 25 minutes was a deeper voice calling, as if searching for someone. We could not make out what the person was saying, and it seemed odd to both of us that the vocalizations were exact replicas of each other, that is, each call sounded identical to the other. It was almost as if someone was walking around with a tape-recorded selection repeating plays in uneven short intervals. The vocalizations seemed to rapidly circle the RV park along a bordering creek and hedge-row. This movement of the sounds would have required the individual to be constantly running. My wife and I both observed out the windows in the trailer, looking for a flashlight or some other indication of someone searching. The security lighting in the RV park made it difficult to notice forms outside the perimeter. The tone and timbre, and completely unintelligible nature of the vocalization seemed similar to the ""samurai chatter"" recordings on the BFRO website. At one point the vocalizations became so close to our trailer and so loud that my wife became profoundly afraid. I began wondering if any of the other guests in the park had been awakened, and if they were shaken up as we were. At about 3 AM a car drove up from the highway and three passengers with flashlights exited the vehicle, and proceeded to their campsite. The car drove away. This activity brought silence to our unintelligible visitor, and we were not disturbed for the rest of the night. At 7 AM I asked the RV park manager if he had heard “all of the commotion” the previous night, and he said that he had not heard a thing.

Later, she went out and took some photos. Here is one showing where the creature walked. On the right side is the west bathroom window. She went to the tombstone, and standing next to it, it came to her waist. She is 5’6” tall, and in her estimation the creature was over 7 feet tall.

Sometime later, a boy friend & I observed what we were told must have been a bear in a thicket of alder trees near the house. The feces found there later contained crawdad shells and berry seeds, with a horrible odor, but the creature we saw was not a bear. The hard dry ground showed no tracks. Our fathers were loggers and we were well versed in the local wild life. While this all happened a very long time ago, I still get cold chills remembering those sounds. Years later, my fiance & I were driving North on Oregon's Hwy 101 near Cape Perpetua North of Florence, OR. The highway is narrow, two lane, with Pacific Ocean on the West & steep rock cliffs on the East. I was watching the moon over the ocean, turned sidewise, facing the ocean. A very large black creature rose from a cleft in the cliff and towered over the little car we were in. My fiance yelled ""What the hell was that?""

My fiance searched for a place to turn around as he wanted to go back, and I refused to let him. We were armed with what suddenly seemed to be a very small weapon, considering the size of the creature! When we returned home, my fiance told his father about the encounter. His father told us of the rancher at the foot of the Capes (Also on Hwy 101) who had been riding to check on his cattle when he heard a cow bellowing in agony. His horse became nervous but he forced it on and found a very large hairy animal chewing on the live cow. He carried a 30.06 rifle and shot the creature. It stood up and ran off on two legs. He followed until he lost the trail of blood in the rocky terrain. This is the first time I have ever heard of someone shooting and wounding one of these creatures. It is also the first time I've heard of this creature eating meat of any kind. Our encounter was in the late evening with clear skies and a full moon. My fiance saw the creature in the headlights and had a great view of it. He knew it was not a bear, and didn't think it was human in a fur suit.

This incident occurred in early 1980 near Arago, about 5-7 miles from Lampa Mountain. I had a paper route then and I was delivering newpapers from my truck to the residents of that area. It has been so long ago I don't remember the road name, but it was about 0330 and it was raining slighty when I came around a sharp corner in the road and saw the back of a large animal quickly crossing the roadway and climbing the side of the roadcut. The road cut was covered with grass about 2 feet high and was about 10 feet high and proabably at a 70 degree angle. As large bears are common in this area due to the sheep population, I initially assumed it was a reddish brown colored bear I was driving by. The animal must have been at least 6 foot long and had very long hair along its spine. I remember very clearly the part in the hair along the spine, due to the wet weather. I passed within 15 feet of the animal as it climbed very quickly to the top of the road cut and out of sight. What always struck me as odd is that the animals spine did not flex like that of a bear when it was moving, and that its rear legs were not directly under it, more out to its sides as it climbed out of sight.

I have spent a great deal of time in the forest. I have been fortunate to have seen almost every species of animal that we have in the state. In Alaska I have seen a Kodiak Bear, Caribou, Blue Foxes, Moose. You name it I have seen it. On the fourth day of our Elk Hunt on November 14, 1995. It was Overcast, but not raining. There were 5 people in our hunting party. The hunt was for 3 point or better bull elk. I was on a treeline/ridgeline trail that was following both down the edge of a reprod unit that was approximately 15 years old. There was another ridge approximately 50 yards accross from where I was. It was approximately 40 yards to the bottom of the ravine and an equal distance back up the other side. I was doing the usual as I made my way down the trail. Go a few yards stop look and listen. From the corner of my eye, I spotted some movement off to my right on the next ridge over. It was about 70 yards as the crow flies at the time I first saw it. My first thought was that the hunter must have a death wish wearing that color clothes out here. Then I quickly realized that it was not a man at all. The Bigfoot was walking upright on two feet. It did not have four legs, but two arms and two legs. It covered 30 yards distance in a few strides. I still had not ruled out that it could be a hunter. By this time it was not more than 45 yards directly accross from where i was kneeled down at. The Bigfoot stopped in a small patch of the reprod where there weren't any small trees. But, there was a downed alder tree that made a wishbone shape. Like a Y. The alder was laying on the hillside, the bottom of the Y would have been on the left side of my field of vision, the downhill side, the right side of the Y was laying on the ground, and the left side of the Y was up in the air. Can you picture this? I could clearly see by now that this was not a man, bear or any other animal that I have ever seen before in my life. Not in pictures, or in person. I put my little nikon binoculars up on it and watched to see more details of it. It did not have pointy ears that a bear would have had. Nor the big square head. What this Bigfoot did next amazed me, it put one of its big hands on the upper part of the alder. Then it proceeded to swing it's legs over the alder and sit down on the alder like you or I would sit on a fence rail. Can you picture this? It now had it's back to me. Then it sat there, by now I was a little scared.. I knew that this Bigfoot probably had some family somewhere in the vicinity, say 1/4 to 1/2 mile of where we were. I was pretty scared. By now I had determined that this Bigfoot was not a man, and I had drawn my Remington Model 721 chambered in .270 Winchester on him to see him through my scope, and for extra security. The scope was a Simmons 3x9 Deerfield II. I kneeled there on the knob where I was for at least 30 minutes and watched it. I whistled and made attempts to make the Bigfoot turn and look at me. I had my finger on the trigger as I watched all this time. The Bigfoot sat on that alder and his legs were swinging like you or I would swing them on a fence rail. The Bigfoot was reaching with his arms and picking foliage up, and I presume it was eating it. I couldn't see for sure because it's back was still to me. After about 30 minutes I decided that I needed to get going because It was approaching 2:00 pm and would be dark before 4:00 in the trees. The only way down would have been to walk my ridge down and it would have crossed the trail Bigfoot was on about 100 yards downhill from where I was. I was about 1 mile down from the beginning of the ridge. It was a good 4 or 5 miles by road to where the vehichles would be on the bottom. I turned heel and made my way up the ridge line trail as fast as I could, looking over my shoulder all the while. Until it was out of my site it remained on that same alder sitting there swinging it's legs. I walked the mile or so up the ridgeline trail to the old skid road that I broke off of to begin with. When I got to the gravel road I never turned back. It was about 4 miles to the bottom flats and I walked at a brisk pace. I got down to the vehichles around 3:00 and everyone was worried that I didn't come out on the creekbed trail. I had made this same run numerous times. One of my hunting partners even shot a 6x6 bull within 50 yards of where I saw and watched the Bigfoot, he shot it the previous year. November of 1994. I have been back there to that same spot since then. I could take you to the exact spot where that Bigfoot was. Since that experience I have seen two different ""footprints"" within a 2 mile radius of where I saw the Bigfoot at. I was with two other people when I saw them. I could easily fit my size 10 boot inside the print. with 2-3 inches on the front left and 2 inches on the back so we are talking about a foot like Shaquille O'Neal. Size 20 at least. When you respond I will have the exact road names and numbers for you. If you are wondering credibility because it is so late in the evening. I was on my way home and my girlfriend asked if I believed in it and why nobody could prove it. It prompted me to get on the net and look for any sites. I have never reported this to anyone outside of hunting party and a few close friends. I can still picture it like it was this afternoon though. I will never forget what I saw that day.

I walked east along an old dirt logging road but it ended at the edge of a steep creek. The brush was very thick and I couldn't get through so I followed the creek in a southerly direction, walking through the ""slash"" (all the debris left over from clear cutting.) Actually, stumbling is a more apt description of my mode of travel. If you've been in a clear cut you know what I mean. Anyhow, I came upon a small spot of soft dirt next to a trunk and saw a footprint about an inch deep. It was a bare foot and just slightly bigger than my male size 10 1/2 in combat boots. I could plainly see the toes. I couldn't imagine how anyone could walk barefooted in that area. I found I couldn't get where I wanted to go due to some wicked stickers so I left. I kept thinking about that print and decided to go back with a camera. Unfortunately, it rained for about 4 days. When it cleared up, I went back and stumbled around some more but it was washed pretty clean. However, I found some other prints that were bigger than the original, and some impressions that were smaller than my own foot (a youngster?). I tried taking pictures and can send them, but they aren't very clear. I could sort of see the track they took and I figured the stride to be about 6 feet between prints. The next day I entered the forest from the north. I followed a dirt road that led to another clearcut. From a high point I could see the area I had been in the day before, so I was sort of north-east of the original spot on the other side of the creek. I saw a beautiful deer and a snake there and found some more impressions. They appeared to be about 15 inches long with the same 6 foot stride. They were not well defined as the ground was hard and may have been made before the rain. I'm not a tracker, but I stood at the print and looked in the direction of travel and could see what appeared to be a trail. That's how I figured the stride. 2 of my strides=6 feet.

When I got there I heard the cattle again. This time a huge bi- pedal animal ran up the side of the road directly at me. It was 7+ feet tall, huge shoulders, covered in reddish blonde, brown hair, no neck, pointed head, long arms and shorter legs. I could hear the bare feet slapping the road surface as it ran. I was frozen with fear. This thing came within 100 feet of me and stopped. I could see its breath as it stood there breathing heavily.

I will advance the theory that when the charging animal in full view of his target did not react by fleeing, it caused it to pause and take the safest course of action by hiding itself. He stated during the wait for #3 of the group, what sounded like a long conversation took place all around them. The ""Raccoon chatter"" sounded to the witness like they were communicating with each other. When the 3rd member arrived, he had an ashen appearance like the blood was drained out of his face.

I will try to keep it simple. I had recently purchased a used vehicle and we decided to take it for a test drive to Laverne Park, which is just a short drive into the mountains from where we live. I was with my girlfriend, her 14 year old daughter, and my dog. After passing the park, we drove on further to see the country. We found a right turn and followed the rural road up into the forest. I later found out that we were traveling up Moon Creek. Not long after heading up the road, my car started overheating. I didn't have water on me so I decided to stop at the first water source, which was a bridge of the creek. I pulled over and we got out. While stepping out of the truck by girlfriend said, "" hey, there is something walking on the hill above us"". We stopped and listened for a moment but it was quiet. I then looked for a place to collect some water from the creek but it turned out that the edge of the water was too steep to step down and get water from. So, I had come up with a quick plan to connect some string to a cup and ""fish"" the water from the bridge. While we were trying to get the cup to fill, a small stone was thrown at us and bounced on the concrete of the bridge we were on. I looked up and noticed a steep hillside above us wondering what the hell could throw a rock at us. I noticed my dog was sitting in my truck, which she never does while I'm out of it in the wilderness. I was getting a little spooked so I tried to speed up the process of getting the water in the cup. Then, another stone bounced on the bridge next to us. I literally watched it skip along the cement. I mentioned that we better hurry, and then, from somewhere up the hill, came a very large rock, about the size of a softball of larger. It smashed against a huge rock in the creek and busted into pieces. I stood up on the bridge, looked at my girlfriends daughter and said, ""let's go now!"" My girlfriend and dog were already in the truck when I slammed the hood down and dove inside. We drove down the mountain and pulled over. I had left so fast that I didn't put the radiator cap back on. I considered returning after getting water to try to get pictures, but my girlfriend wouldn't let us go back.

The girlfriend did not see a figure but heard walking, crunching, two branch breaks about 100 feet away. While the boyfriend was dropping string and cup over the bridge, two rocks landed four to five feet away from him. Each rock was just a little larger than a marble. He saw the second rock roll by him. Then the softball sized rock hit a large boulder that was thirty to forty feet away, in the water but near the edge of the creek. The rock shattered and the pieces landed in the water. No foul odor was detected. The witness is not sure what fish may be in this creek but has seen crawdads in it. He believes, and I agree, that a Bigfoot thought he was fishing because he had a string hanging over the bridge.

He had taken my truck and left me at camp with his truck and camper. I departed camp on Saturday morning, proceeding at a slow pace to the north/northwest. Neither of us had seen any elk since opening day, the previous Wednesday, so I wasn't hopeful of success that day either. I had proceeded a short distance, less than a half mile and one hour elapsed, when I became aware of a sound that captured my interest. It was the sound of wood on wood striking. Upon hearing the noise, I paused to evaluate its possible origin. It seemed to be between 200-300 yards distant. I at first thought of somebody chopping wood. There is an unimproved road that travels the approximate route I had taken. However, that road starts where I was camped and nobody had been by in a couple of days. Also the sound was in groups of 3 or more whacks. As fast as you or I can say aloud, ""whack, whack, whack"", is as fast as the sounds were materializing. I deduced that to rule out chopping wood with an ax, as someone using an ax typically takes a full backswing and then must extract the ax from the piece. Both of those acts take too much time to explain these sounds. Later, my dad said he thought it must have been forest grouse. I tentatively took this for the truth until I myself heard forest grouse a few years later and the sounds were not the same. The sounds continued, never varying direction, but always staying ahead of me as I walked, though I was catching up. Finally, I reached a place where the sounds were no more than 50 yards distant, though the maker remained hidden by a rise on the opposite side of the intermittent creek I was overlooking. I sat down on a log to plan my next move and the sounds continued. There was just something so unusual about them that I was becoming very uneasy. I decided, in spite of the .300 Winchester magnum in my hands, to retreat to F.S. 16 and return to camp. I was so shaken by what I had heard that I stayed in the camper the rest of the day to await my friend's return late that night. Later in the afternoon and into the night, I repeatedly heard a noise like a vehicle crossing a cattle guard at low speed (20mph). It was a low rumbling sound. Indeed, there is a cattle guard on F.S. 16 that can be heard from the camp site and initially this is what I thought I was hearing. What is noteworthy is that this sound was not coming from vehicles on the road. I could also easily hear and see trucks on F.S. 16 and few occurrences of this noise could be attributed to passing vehicles. These noises continued into the night until I went to bed. My friend returned and the rest of the trip came off without incident. For years, I tentatively assumed that what I heard had a generally recognized origin. In June of 1995, an interest feature on Bigfoot in the Oregonian newspaper described ""tree whacking"" as a communication medium of Bigfoot creatures. At that point, I was quite certain of what I had heard.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,groups of 3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"The witness defined the locations of his camp, the cattle guard and his position in the forest with precision on Topozone.

I was 16. At around 11 PM, three of us were asleep and two were up. Even though we were within the wilderness area, we had parked our car some ways down a very hard to negotiate road by a stream bed and had ascended a small hill where there was a campground with easy water access a little further up the stream. One boy, George, went down the hill to get something out of the car, and as he approached the car something which had been hanging out near it took off and ran downstream. It was so loud that Matt, the other wakeful boy, heard it too, and they said it sounded like a jeep going through the brush without a motor. But the real fun started about two hours later, when horrible screams started to be heard from a distance. The sounds eventually woke all of us up, and I must say there were of an incredibly scary nature, not cats or anything even like that. More like metal ripping in a factory. Eventually it became obvious that the creature was making its way towards our camp by the stream, and, machetes in hand in the case of two boys, we all hid deep in our sleeping bags. Well, the camp spent about a half hour estimated under siege by something walking around it on two feet, and continuing to let out these massive wails while us boys shivered in our sleeping bags in utter terror. Finally, the creature started to move away, and as it did, two or three of us looked carefully out to see a huge hulking form moving away in the minor moonlight. This is absolutely a true story, whatever this creature was, its ""wail"" could raise the dead. George and Matt were the totally skeptical types, and the experience shook them tremendously.

Communications between the landing and brush were via hand held walkie talkie. The guys in the brush spotted something moving across a prairie about 2500 ft. across the canyon from the yarder. They thought it might have been an elk but weren't sure. After telling the yarder engineer about it and asking what he thought it was, the engineer had me get a rifle w/scope out of the crummy so as to have a better look. Both the yarder engineer and I took turns looking at this creature through the rifle scope for approx. 15 minutes. We both came to the conclusion that the creature was not a bear, elk, deer or any of the commonly known big game animals that habit these woods around here. The creature was definitely walking upright and on two legs. It had broad shoulders, reddish brown coloured hair, and didn't seem to be in a big hurry gettin to where it was goin. I could see it's arms swinging as it walked and seemed to have a pointed or conical shaped head. I could't distinguish the facial features as it was just too far away. The creature was headed in a E.N.E. direction from us quartering up the hill across the prairie towards the ridge of the hill. We watched the creature until it disappeared over the ridge it was headed towards. On our way home after work we debated what the creature was and concluded that it was a bigfoot.

The plan was to pick huckleberries and fly fish for steelhead. I was about 10-12 and got bored picking berries real fast. I was old enough grandpa would let me row the boat alone but not use the motor so I went back to the boat and rowed as far up as I could 'til the current got too strong, beached it, and hiked a couple hundred yards up the bank through a big boulder pile at the bottom of a steep clay bank. Between the bottom of the clay and edge of the water was a rock shelf with the boulders lying on it, about 20-30 feet wide. The river had dropped overnight and there was a layer of mud about an inch, maybe 1.5 inches thick on the rock shelf. Just below the pocket I was going to fish I noticed a set of large tracks coming out of the water, crossing that ledge, and heading up the clay bank. Back then, the minimum size limit was 8"" for trout and we all had notches cut 8"" up in the cork in our rod butts as a guage to know which fish were legal. Using that, I guestimated the tracks at 24-1/2"" long and 8-1/2"" wide. I didn't measure the heel, but the foot didn't taper as quickly as a human foot. I guestimated the stride at 6-1/2 feet using the 8-1/2 foot length of the rod. The stride didn't appear to shorten as it went up the bank, it just went up. I don't think I could have climbed that bank without a rope, it wasn't vertical, just very darn steep. There was no sign of whatever it was using the short shrubbery to boost itself along, either.

I take professional photos for a website I operate and was hoping to get in some great scenic shots before it got to cold and lousy for the rest of the year. My fiance and I were on a hike about six or eight miles above Brookings Oregon, in Curry county. We were on a hiking trail in a densely wooded area following a trail called the loop trail. This trail is about a quarter of a mile past the area called Natural Bridges viewpoint. We had gone down the trail without incident, although it was getting dark and I felt as though we needed to hurry to get back, even though there was no reason to. It was just a feeling like the hairs on the back of my neck had started to stand up. I can't quite explain it, I just suddenly felt uncomfortable. We did not see any other hikers while we were on our way back up the trail, or on the way down. We stopped walking when we heard some loud snaps in the forest around us, like something was breaking tree branches. We looked around, but did not see anything at first. We decided to keep walking, when we saw some bushes about twenty yards ahead of us sway back and forth. We stopped again and were then assaulted by a horrific smell that reminded me of garbage baking in the sun. By then, the nervous feeling I had had intensified and I was really beginning to worry about the onset of fog and the fading light. The forest was misty and it was raining lightly. We were climbing a steep part of the trail and I gave it my best push to get to the end of the trail. As we were finishing the final climb, I turned and looked behind me. I'm not sure why. It was like I knew someone was watching and yet I told myself I was just being silly. When I turned, I saw a head above some tree branches with the rest of the body obscured by the heavy vegetation. The head was covered in Dark, reddish brown fur and was impossibly far from the ground. If this was a man he must have been at least close to eight feet tall. I blinked a couple times convinced I was seeing things. The thing I was looking at did not disappear. Instead it looked at me curiously for a few seconds and then moved out of my view behind a tree. I grabbed my fiance's hand, too afraid to tell him what I had seen because I thought he might go looking for it and then made my way back to our vehicle as fast as I could. I am not crazy.

She went on to tell me about her trip to Oregon and how she grew up in the region and loved hiking in the area near the coast. During a hike in the late afternoon she and her fiancée began to hear what she said sounded like ""good sized trees being broken at ground level."" She described this sound as incredibly loud in the relatively serene surroundings of the hiking trail. She said that her initial feeling was that the sound was created by a bear, and began to urge her partner to start heading back to the trailhead as it was getting close to dusk, there was a light drizzle, and the air was starting to get a chill. She said that all the while she felt uncomfortable, as if ""someone were watching her."" She also stated that there was a smell of ""sour coffee grounds"" or ""rotten garbage"" in the air. As they headed down the trail she noticed that wildlife sounds in the area all at once became silent. This was particularly curious to her as well as her fiancée, so they hastened their pace in a steep part of the trail only to hear more very loud ""breaking trees"" again thinking they were in the presence of a bear. At this point she caught movement out of the corner of her right eye and looked around where she saw from a distance of about 25 feet a very large figure, obscured from the chest down peering over a tree branch at her. She gaped in disbelief for about 3 seconds and grabbed her partner's hand. By the time she turned to look again, the figure was gone. Her fiancée was seemingly unaware and later reported that he did not see the subject. While the glimpse was relatively quick, she said it felt like ""moments"" because of the unusual nature of the eight-foot figure. She described the face as that of a ""person"" but ""twice as big"" with a long, reddish-brown receding hairline and light brown, human-like facial skin. She said that the nose was proportionally long compared to the rest of the face, and rounded with wide nostrils. The large, dark eyes were greenish in color, with no whites visible, just irises. She said that the subject's very muscular (""bulging"") right shoulder connected to its head at the jawbone, with no real sense of neck at all, and that the chest was ""as wide as a person is tall."" She described the most fascinating aspect of the incident was the complexity of the subject's expression. She detected genuine curiosity emanating from the figure's face as if it could not help but reveal itself to her because of that curiosity. As the couple rapidly descended to the trailhead they discussed what they had just heard and what she had seen, and neither had any tangible explanation. The witness went on to express how this event had changed her assessment of wildlife and the outdoors and instilled a new fear of hiking and camping. I found this witness to be extremely credible. Her discussion of the event came from a scientific vantage point, and she expressed curiosity regarding why this particular subject had singled her out, and the meaning of the apparent behavior.",yes,yes,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=36671

Fahrenbach,1963,NA,NA,Summer,B,footprint,NA,Teddy Lakes in Three Sisters Wilderness Area,Bend,Cascades Lakes Highway,Three Sisters Wilderness Area,43.8628205,-121.882875,1503.7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lake , forest",pine trees,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I have been reading your site for the last couple of years, and thought I'd share some experiences I've had over the years. Nothing particularly groundbreaking, but it may add to your database. I have been interested in Sasquatch/Bigfoot since I was a small boy growing up in Central Oregon hearing stories from my uncles and their friends about the goings on in Northern California in the 50s' and 60s'. While there was a lot of skepticism about the possibility of such a creature existing, there was also an underlying acceptance of the possibility that it could exist. My family, and most of the people I knew, spent a lot of time in the woods hunting, fishing, and camping. My grandfather and uncle were expert hunters and woodsmen, and taught me those skills from the time I could walk. In the first 20 years of my life, most of my free time was spent hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, and exploring the wild areas around my hometown. In 1963, my grandfather, mother, brother, and I hiked in to Teddy Lakes in the Three Sisters Wilderness area to go fishing. In those days the Forest Service kept a wooden rowboat at the lake for people to use. We took the boat out and fished for awhile and decided to explore the far end of the lake. There is a small cove at that end of the lake with an island at the mouth of the cove. The cove itself is shallow and swampy. As we rowed around the island we could hear splashing on the other side, and thought maybe had disturbed a bear or an elk. When we rounded the island, the animal was gone, but the ripples in the water were still evident. We took the boat over to the shallows to examine the tracks the animal had left to determine what it was. Most of the area between the island and the shore was maybe 5 or 6 feet deep up to within about 50 feet of the shore where there was about a foot of water over soft mud. What we saw has stuck in my mind for the rest of my life. There was a clear line of tracks where the animal had emerged from the deeper water and walked through the shallows leaving very deep tracks on the mud. It looked like the tracks of a very large man, only wider, longer, and deeper. It was clearly the trail of a two legged creature taking large steps leaving about a 15"" track very deep in the mud. My grandfather and I pondered those tracks for a long time trying to come up with an explanation for what made them. All I can say for absolute certainty is that it was not a bear, elk, or any other animal known to live in the area. We tried to follow the animal into the woods, but lost the trail in the deep forest litter. The reason those tracks have stuck in my mind for so long are two fold. While I was only 9 years old at the time, I had spent several years learning the tracks of the animals in the area, and felt very confident in my ability to identify the maker of the track, when it was made, where the animal was going, etc. I had absolutely no idea what made that track. My grandfather, who was an absolute expert hunter and tracker also could not identify those tracks. We had many discussions over the years as to what that animal was, and never did come up with a plausible explanation. As I have learned more about the Sasquatch from reading books over the years, I have come to think it might have been our elusive furry friend. Another important point is that before rowing over to the island, we had been fishing in the lake for an hour or so talking most of the time. This is a small lake, and any wild animal would have heard us and left the area well before we rowed to the island. The tracks were made by a very large animal. The large animals known to exist in the area are bear, elk, cougar, and deer. All of those animals flee at the first hint of people. It is true that cougars will occasionally observe people from concealment, but I have never known one to swim out to an islad to watch people fishing in a boat. Whatever the animal was, it was watching us from the island and only left when we approached. We didn't smell or hear anything other than the sounds of the animal moving through the water as it went through the shallows. Another incident happened in 1970 or 71 while bowhunting for deer in the Swampy Lakes area West of Bend. I had driven to Tumalo Falls and walked from there in the general direction of Swampy Lakes. I had been out since before dawn hunting and just hiking around, and had stopped around noon to have some lunch and rest. It was a sunny day, with the sound of the wind in the pine trees, and an occasional bird calling. I was having a nice time soaking it all in and thinking about where I was going to go that afternoon. All of a sudden, I got this overwhelming feeling of being watched, and became very anxious. I am not one to become overly excited especially when in the woods. I am very comfortable in the wilds, and had spent countless days in situations just like that day. It is in fact where I feel most comfortable and at home. Anyway, I could not figure out why I was feeling nervous, and began scanning the area carfully to see if I could spot an animal. I didn't see anything, and had just about got myself calmed down when I heard a twig snap in some dense jackpines maybe 60 feet from me. There was something walking in there and it definitely had my full attention. I was now standing with an arrow nocked in my bow trying to see what was in there. Whatever it was stayed out of sight, and didn't make any more noise. I stood there for about 5 very long minutes trying to decide what to do next. I was feeling a little silly about being so scared, and decided to investigate. So I walked around the thicket where the noise came from thinking I could see better from the other side. I didn't go more than a few steps when there was a snap from a branch breaking inside the thicket. It was loud enough that I knew it was a large animal. It was all I could do to keep myself from taking off at a dead run. I was an hour or two from the nearest trail, and maybe another hour from my car. I knew that I couldn't outrun any animal that was making the noise. The fact that I was so scared was what was confusing me the most. It made no sense to me. I have had bears come into my camp at night, and not had anything approaching the overwhelming fear that I experienced that day. I really didn't have any fear of mountain lions or the back bears in the area. We didn't view them as dangerous at the time. Besides, mountain lions don't make noise. You are never going to hear a mountain lion walking throug the woods. They don't snap branches. Bears can be noisy when they are eating and haven't detected you. All of the bears that I had come upon at that time had run as soon as they saw me. This animal was observing me from cover and knew I was aware it was there. I decided that exiting the area was the best call. I gathered my things in my pack and deliberately walked away, keeping a close watch over my shoulder. I did not want to appear panicked and encourage whatever was in there to persue me. I had the distinct feeling that I was being followed from a close distance, and would hear a occasional sound of something moving through the woods. I would turn around to face whatever it was, but never saw anything. This went on for a good hour or so, and then stopped. I walked the rest of the way to the car and drove home. This is the first time I have recounted this experience. The reason I bring it up at all is that other people seem to have had similar experiences. In 1973 a close friend of mine came by my house after a deer hunting trip. He told me that he had seen a big foot while hunting that day. I asked him what he saw and he told me that while sitting by a log at the edge of a clearing, a large hair covered animal 6 or 7 feet tall walked across the clearing in broad daylight about 50 yards in front of him. He told me he shot the animal with his 30-06, it let out a scream and ran into the woods. I grilled him for awhile about the details of the encounter, and I believed he was telling the truth. This happened in the area of Wickiup reservoir south of Bend Oregon. I was very angry with him for shooting the animal, and he wouldn't speak to me about it for a long time after that. I have lost touch with him, but I know some people who may know where he is if you want to follow up. About a year after that incident, another man told me he had an encounter near Three Creeks Lake Northwest of Bend. He and another man were sitting on the tailgate of their pick up after a day's deer hunting, waiting for a third man to return. It was after dusk. They said that they smell a foul odor, and something shook the bushes and threw branches and stones at them. At the time, I didn't pay much attention to this story, but it does seem consistent with some of the behaviors described in John Bindernagel's book. The last incident happened at Fish Lake near Bluff Creek in September of 2002. I had been on a solo backpacking trip from Elk Meadows to the Dillon Divide area, and was spending my last night at the lake before leaving the area the next day. I hadn't seen any sign of Bigfoot, but had a great trip exploring some beautiful country. It was about 11 at night, and I was about half asleep in my tent. I heard a very loud whoop that sounded like it came from directly across the lake. The sound went from low to high, and lasted a couple of seconds. What was striking was the volume. It was louder than an elk bugling.

The early spring of 1976 I was living in a small log cabin on the banks of Tumalo Creek approx 10 miles into the foothills of the Central Oregon Cascades outside of Bend, Oregon. I took my water out of the creek and had an outhouse. One day I was hiking cross-country up the hillside up from my cabin when I came upon some extremely large, flat-footed footprints in the soft dirt of the Ponderosa Pine forest. They were exactly like the ones I have since seen on your website. There was a logging road that switched- backed up the hillside. Other than occasional logging trucks, no one else used that road except for occasional hunters in the fall. I was very surprised, to say the least. I had never heard any mention of Bigfoot sightings in that region before that but went to the library and found out indeed there had been some. It struck me that it was very unlikely to be a hoax as no one would expect anyone to be out walking in that area, so an unlikely place to place bogus footprints. The footprints were coming up the hillside from the area of my cabin and at first it frightened me to think I was sharing an environment with such a powerful creature.

(Crescent Lake junction). It was a late August day. And I had decided to do some creek fishing. I went thru some private property where Marsh creek and Crescent creek meet. I started hiking up Marsh creek and had gone thru several larger Alpine clearings with the feeling that something was watching me. There was lots of wildlife, cows and horses about so I didn't worry too much about it. After crossing the last fence line and now deep into the Deschutes National Forest I started fishing. Picture a 50 yrd clear swath where no trees grow. Up next to the creek the bank line is lined with willow type bushes and makes it impossible to have a clear view up the creek. So many times I had to hike over to the tree line to continue up the creek. At one point, about a 1/2 mile from the fence line, I had hiked to the trees to make the next clearing at the creek to fish. Being volcanic ground (pumice) I would fish from several feet away then slowly work my way to the creek side. I had fished this particular spot for about 10 mts. by the time I made the creek side. I looked up at the treeline across the creek (25 yards). At that point I realized I had just walked up to Bigfoot. He was rested against a lightning strike stump that was 5 ft. high, his butt sitting down just a bit, and looking over his right shoulder he was watching my every move. We made eye contact looking at each other staring. I could see the full length of his arms, the size of his entire body. The color of his hair covered body. His facial features almost sad looking, more human than gorilla. More expression than you could ever imagine. I broke my rod down without reeling in the line and began to move away as fast as I could, watching him the entire time completely afraid for my life. He, just as startled, stood up from the 5 foot high stump he was resting his butt against, and began to run away from me up the creek as I ran down the creek. His arm length was to his knees, his height at 8 or better ft tall. The speed in which he was able to run from me was incredible. Needless to say he was afraid of me as I was of him (thank God). I've spent my entire life hunting and fishing back country and have never again seen anything like this. Thia was a real life sighting of BIGFOOT in the daylight, no obstruction from 25 yrds.

The witness describes the subject as being about 8ft tall and most likely weighing in around 450-500 pounds. He describes its hair as dark, coarse in appearance and frizzy. The hair seemed to be 2-3inches over his body with the belly and legs having slightly shorter hair and the shoulders and head having longer hair, more likely 6-8 inches. The hair was not well kept, but rather matted. The witness also described his face as being ape-like, with a flat nose and dark calloused cheek skin with hair beginning again below the cheeks. The subject had a rather long forehead and prominent brow ridge. The witness stated that he would liken the subject to being maybe one step off the evolutionary chain from humans to apes. The subject had uncharacteristically long arms compared to a human and definite fingers as opposed to paws. This was definitely not a bear. A bad smell did seem to emanate from the subject, it was more comparable to the way a bear smells. Not an overwhelming smell but, also not a pleasant one. The area that the subject was seen in was a densely bushed creek side while sitting against a lightning strike stump. The witness believes that the creature had been watching him working his way up the creek the entire time, but only decided to leave after the witness noticed him. There were no vocalizations made by the subject either before or after the encounter. The witness and the subject locked eyes for maybe 5-10 seconds before they both decided to leave, in opposite directions. The witness did notice the subject's gait as it left, and noted that he was bent forward as if bearing a significant weight. The witness did not return to the area to look for hair or prints due to being a little shocked by the whole encounter and undoubtedly uneasy about it.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=37044

Any one I told about it at the times made fun of me because they said they were all black. It was at night in the summer of 1980. My husband was a farm worker and got off work very late. The grocery store would stay open all night so once a month we went into the grocery store when he got off work. We were comming back from the store heading home and the three kids were asleep in the back seat and my husband was dosing off in the passinger seat. Because there had been so many deer out that year I was driving rather slowley incase one ran out in front of me. I saw what I thought at first was a deer come from the brush and trees on the left side of the road. I slowed way down for it to cross in fromt of me. It was not a deer though, it was a very large light redish brown very hairy man. When the car lights hit his eyes it made him blinded like it dose deer and he stopped in front of me and shielded his eyes. His eyes did not shine red, like the wild animals eyes do. His skin was a light brown or tan and he had like freckling on his hands and exposed areas around his eyes. I know he was male because I could see his male parts in the lights from the car. He was right there looking face to face with me. I stopped the car completely because I was afraid I would hit him. He got his berrings and turned a walked off the road. He did have a neck, but it was very short, the muscles in the top of his arms and shoulders were built up like a weight lifters and with the hair gave him the apearance of being humped built. I could see him through his hair, because the lights were shining right through it. I had what we called running lights on the car for me when I drove at night because I have trouble driving in the very dark nights so he was light up like a christmas tree. He was young and in good shape wih well developed muscles. Tall enough that his male parts were above the level of the ford hood when he reached his arms up. He also had a smell about him, a very strong smell. Like a man who has been hitchiking for a few weeks and a dog mixed together. The smell stayed in the car for a while. I had the road vents open. i also remember that he had head hair that was long that hung over his body hair and what seemed like beard hair on his face that started up under his eyes and covered his nose and left out only his mouth. His teeth were brown, his nose full and wide and his mouth had like full lips with the hair growing up over them. I have had other distance sitings in the Oregon woods, as when I was young I spent a lot of time there, but this was my only face to face. I just sat there in a amazement after he was gone. Then my husband waked up and asked why we were stopped.

The witness is of the feeling that they are occasional visitors to the ranch. Reasons to believe this include the fact that the witness hears very unusual and loud vocalizations in the distance at least a couple times a year. Further, there have been nights, at widely spaced intervals, when ""something is out there"" as evidenced by the dog hiding under the bed in an uncharacteristic manner, and the house being subsequently filled with a strong stench that hangs around until morning before dissipating. After these evenings, she has sometimes noticed disturbed items in some outbuildings and some missing canned goods.

I worked nearby on a horse ranch and rode extensively into the Deschutes National Forest on extended rides to the end of old logging roads into small valleys, toward the Three Sisters Mountains. Once I remember my bounding cow dog running from my front and staying behind my horse. A few minutes later the horse was alerted to something in the distance and refused to go any further. It was in this direction I drove the Chevy truck toward where I could cut down some long, straight narrow poles to pay off my rent. I drove up a narrow road that ended with a loop around a big Douglas fir. The valley was steep to both sides with steady elevation increases to the west toward the Cascade Mountains. I had a hand tree saw and an ax, and I started to cut down, clean up, and drag several pole trees toward the road/truck. About 15-20 minutes later I started to hear faint crackling from the ridge above to my south, like a large deer or elk was walking about. As I continued to work the sounds became louder, more frequent, and generally closer. I could not see what it was but thought it might be a bear. Forest was not that thick but I could only hear the crunching of something coming closer and making its presence known. I had no permit to cut the trees, and whatever was seemed kept getting louder and closer (I could hear snapping dry limbs), so I decided to leave.A few days later I enlisted a friend to go with me to get the poles I had cut. I told him of what I had experienced and he thought I was full of it. I brought a .22 rifle. Upon arriving we proceeded to load up the poles I had left and cut some more. The same thing happened. In about 20 minutes something slowly and methodically came crackling down from the south ridge toward us. At first my friend thought I was pulling a prank on him, that I had enlisted a friend to scare him. As it became apparent this was not the case the 'thing' was within maybe 100 yards of us, behind some old dead trees. It broke more limbs, and we migrated to the pickup, which was parked just before the end of the road and the large Douglas Fir. We sat in silence. Nothing. A few minutes later the noises were back, coming from the woods behind the large Fir. I drove to within maybe 50 feet of the Tree. Embolden with my friend, the truck, and the 22, I opened the door and took maybe two steps toward the tree. Something was behind the tree, and it made an extremely loud noise that when into our core. My best remembrance of it was like a cross between a bear and a lion with a megaphone. I have never experienced anything like it since. Pure fear. I bolted back on the truck, we backed up, turned around and left as fast as we could. I left the ax, bow saw, and some unloaded poles. We didn't tell anyone because I wasn't supposed to be up their in the first place and had no wood cutting permit. Whatever it was, although extremely close, never showed itself.

Three or four days later he returned with a friend. Again after chopping wood for about twenty to thirty minutes, they heard branch breaks and limbs cracking. Whatever it was, the approach was a little faster this time. As reported, they went back to the pickup. When he got out of the truck with the .22 rifle, the large fir tree was less than 100 feet away. After one or two steps the roar stopped him. He described the vocalization as a guttural lion roar for about two seconds. Whatever made the vocalization was behind the four foot wide fir tree. I asked him if he thought that it was using the trees to hide behind as it approached. He said he is 100 percent sure of that. He did not detect any foul odor.

It was a very nice sunny day and very peaceful. You really couldn't ask for a better day. As we were floating slowly downstream, we were heading toward a big dirt bank where the river did a 90 degree turn. I remember picking up the stringer of fish to show my friend. I was talking to him about our nice fish when something out of nowhere yelled at us. It was terrible sounding! Never in my life had I heard something like this. It started at a low howl and went up about two to three octaves and then back down again. It was so loud! I am sure you could have heard it a mile upstream. It also lasted a long time (maybe 10 seconds). It sounded more like a person than an animal, but it didn't sound like a person, either. I believe that it came from the top of the 30 foot tall mud bank we were heading towards. The dirt bank was around 100 yards away. We decided to investigate and found nothing. The ground was nothing but pine needles so it would be hard to make a footprint. We were right where we thought we heard this thing. But we saw nothing. I wish I could say I did see something but I can't. What makes this episode strange is that I talked to another friend of mine and told him about what happend. I tried to give him a demonstration of what the thing sounded like. He looked at me and said that I heard bigfoot. Now I thought he was kidding but he said that he had a recording of one. He also told me that his uncle was one of the big Bigfoot explorers. His uncle even made a movie about them. This was news to me. He found this recording on a old record that he had and let me borrow it. What I heard on the record sounded exactly like what I heard. I mean exactly!

We lived less than a mile from the national forest boundary. It ran through a small, vague valley that was in front of me. Sagebrush and the odd rock was in this little valley. The figure I saw was entirely black. It could have been for the lack of light. I also must note that this thing was running fast. If it was a man they must have been running like crazy which is not easy through the maze of sagebrush. I couldn't see any detail which limits my conclusion on this experience. But what I do know is that I never witnessed joggers or sprint runners ever in my neighborhood. And where this being ran there was no trail, no path it was following. It was barren property.

The burned area was very wide open and we were nere some small rock outcrops, there was a catline road around the fire and this is what we parked on. It was approxametly 1:00 and we had no luck so we decided to try one last place and then go home for the day, which is where i have described. We parked and got out quietly and I headed into the woods on the other side of the road, I walked about100 feet in and was startled by a dow jumping out of the brush and fleeing. We decided to go in the direction that the dow had gone thinking that there may be a buck somewhere nearby, my brother in law went off in the direction he thought the dow had gone and I stayed back and looked for tracks to see if there was others. This is when i noticed some very strange prints on the ground, they were like a humans foot print but larger there were about 8 to 12 prints by one creature as far as i could tell the prints were not all in one dorection. It looked as if the creature, animal, or what ever may have shifted its weight or something when it turned because the dirt was pushed up more on the out side of the print in places. I told my partner and he didn't seem to interested he just kept looking for the deer, then he finally came back up over the little rise and I showed him the tracks he didn't seem to know what to think. I kept studying them and tried to come up with an answer for them, I thought maybe the wind but know the chances of the wind making one let alone 8 - 12 of the prints was very unlikely, or rain but there is no way, or a bear but for a bear to be on its hind legs and to take that many steps was very very unlikely. The prints from what I remember were about 12 to 15 inches in size, and some of the strides were possibly 4 to 4 and a 1/2 feet.

The month was September the weather was warm.My husbane had returned to Redmond to go bowling on his league.I stayed behind as some friends were to come up later that evening and join us The State was doing alot of road work and were blasting parts along the hiway to clear space for wider roads. I was putting more wood on the fire when I Looked at my watch our friends were late as usual.It's was 10:30 a friday. You could heard the trucks and the blasting going on along the road. Then there was this real loud blast! It shook the ground under the stump I was sitting on. futher away from the road you could hear a rock slide started from the blast. Then the woods came to life.I could hear running of a very large animal going through everything in his way.UNDERBRUSH WAS SNAPPING AND SMALL TREES COULD BE HEARD CRASHING TO THE GROUND. As the rocks in the canyon stopped sliding the woods became quite again.Then just across the lake from where my tent was pitched the howing and screaming started.These sounds went on for at lest half hour.I being alone at this time became rather unnerved and decided that my tent would be a better place to wait for my friends from.I crawled inside and found my rifle load a shell into the barrel and sat there in the dark.

It flapped vigorously, headed southward directly toward my car, crossed over it and kept going. It was not gliding, it was accelerating. Seconds later, I saw a tall, rangy figure suddenly emerge from the cover of the treeline, about 150 feet ahead on my right, and stride determinedly toward the road across a grassy fringe. As I slowed and closed the distance to within 50 feet, the figure with no hesitation, stopping neither to look in the direction of my approaching car nor to gauge the speed and distance, glided across the two lanes in four strides and kept going directly into the cover of the pines on the other side of the road. I asked my wife if she had seen the 'person' crossing the road. I wanted her opinion of what had transpired before expressing my own suspicions. Unfortunately, she said no - that she had been trying to follow the flight of the hawk behind the car. On immediate reflection, I realized I had seen something unusual but could not say what exactly I had seen. Nor can I say now what it was. But if it was a human being, it was a strange one. The figure seemed not just tall but VERY tall - I would estimate close to 6'8"" to 7' tall (based the figure's height relative to roof of my car). The length of stride required to cross the road in just four strides would be quite large. Its actions did not seem typically human. It did not wait for its chance to cross at the roadside - it waited hidden in the treeline. When its chance came, it never slowed until hidden in the pines on the other side of the road. It didn't even turn toward me, though its efforts indicated it was aware of and concerned by our car's approach. It didn't run or jog as a human might who is caught crossing the road in front of an approaching car. Its step was a well articulated (almost thoughtful) full heel to toe stride with a vigorous push off. It moved briskly with a long swinging arc of the arms, a slightly stiff body-lean with the head and trunk bent forward from the waist. The head was not bent at the neck; I saw no neck; the whole upper torso was bent from the waist. I have thought about the 'clothing'. During the brief seconds, I had seen the figure, the clothing appeared to be completely and uniformly DARK - top to bottom - without distinguishing characteristics. I could not identify the articles of clothing - jacket,jeans, boots, gloves etc. with one exception. The one article of clothing that I might have noted was perhaps a peaked lumberjack's cap with a fuzzy tassle. On reflection, I wonder if it might instead have been the oft-reported pointed head or skull. Please do not put my name or contact information on the public site.

When we stopped to follow fresh bear and elk tracks. We could smell something very bad in the air and thought we were very close to a bear. A large bear. We came across a large stump that had some kind of hair all over it. We studied this for some time trying to figure out what had happened there as the stump had hair all over it and it was also all over the ground. We brought some home with us because it was the strangest fur we had ever felt. This fur was white and very coarse.It was not elk or deer or any fur we knew of. We looked on the ground and notice a set of elk horns that had been dropped We continued down what looked like a game trail and found a wallow. In it were several foot prints from what looked like elk and bear. Also we saw foot prints that were at least 18 inches long and as wide as my foot.(I wear a 6 1/2). shoe.) We followed the tracks and they headed toward a creek. The prints were easy to follow as the ground was clean where they stepped but surrounded with what looked like splashing from wet fur around each print. We investigated further, though I was scared to death, and had noticed the bushes and tree branches had been splashed as well with the muddy water from the wallow. There were tracks every where. What ever made the prints was very heavy. The tracks were deep. My husband who weighs 230 lbs. tried to make prints that deep by jumping next to some and barely dented the ground. My husband, who was a logger and is very familiar with the wilderness had never seen anything like it before and was also astonished. He was curious and wanted to keep investigating but I was so frightened I just wanted to get back in the truck. To the best of our reasoning we figure the tracks were a day old. It had rained on Friday and they had dried enough for us to see them on Sunday afternoon. We usually carry our video camera with us when we go out in the woods but forgot it on this trip. If it doesn’t rain this week my husband is going to go back and film it, he wants to gather more evidence of what is there. I don’t know if I can go back. It may not sound like much in the telling of this story, but in real life you could just feel that something very large and strange lives there and we should not be in this place. This has made such a lasting impression on us both, that we had to come home and tell someone right away.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,prints went toward a creek,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,18,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,also found hair that turned out to be bear,2,"I did view the videotape that was taken at the scene the following day the tracks were found. Impressive but I knew that I had a better chance at seeing the tracks for myself later that afternoon. Upon arriving on scene, the witness K, filled me in on all the details of what happened before they went off into the forest. I did find other impressions of large tracks that were still part of the original subject. Also, I had the opportunity to compare impressions with bear tracks that were less then a few hours old. Impressions were measured and the bear tracks found were used to identify subject from other known animals in the area. The odd colored hair mentioned in their report was of an elk. It appeared to me to be some type of natural salt lick which was the source of attraction to the stump. I did stay until midnight with witnesses. We walked a couple of roads and they wanted know what the BFRO does while out on expeditions or investigations involving overnight stays. Listed were four witnesses, I had the opportunity to meet K and C, but not the other two. I talked to the third witness T. He was the first to contact me by phone. Each conversation, with T, K, and C matched each other’s story. All witnesses were interviewed separately, either by phone or in person. I did view the cast taken, plaster of paris was the compound used to create the casts. They were unable to get Hydrocal in their area and used what they could before the tracks disappeared. Hair samples were collected in two separate areas where the subject had walked and they were sent off to Dr. Henner Fahrenbach for his expertise on the subject. Will update the report when I receive his final analysis. Sample one was taken from a small sapling, at a height of sixty-four inches. Also present were bear markings or scratches on the tree. Sample Two was taken from another tree, which was laid over onto another tree, at a height of about forty-two inches. It was presumed that subject may have stepped over the sapling. UPDATE Hair samples collected from the area were of a bear, according to Dr. Fahrenbach (7/9/05). Dear Mel, Both samples were bear hair, only the short piece was much more pigmented than the longer one. Keep the hair coming! My best, Henner. Sample one was of a bear. Sample two I was hoping to be our subject. Strand was of a different color and texture and it was stretched, causing it to curl. Thinking is. . . the spring left in the tree as the bear stepped over, snapped it up higher as it passed. Thanks to Dr. Fahrenbach's assistance. Even though the hairs turned out to be of a bear. Tracks found and followed in the area were of a much larger and different subject. END OF REPORT",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=11886

They were in sweatshirts it was so chilly. It was at the end of day and they were rushing to get on water. She's unsure if it was a weekday or weekend but believes weekend. It was not crowded at all. Nobody was out. No campers. They paddled to the back side. To the waterfall….really shallow can totally see the bottom, only 18"" deep if that and can see everything. They saw tracks come in off the west side of bank and walking through, the tracks appeared to be following animal tracks. They veered off and went over to a bird nest, it appeared as if there were broken eggs, the tracks then went off to the east side. They think the current would have wiped them away relatively quickly. Strides were 6 - 8' apart and they believe there were about 200 yards of tracks. Water was freezing. Could see outline of footprint, not clearly defined. Size of tracks were about twice her foot size about 18"" x 7"". She remembers only one set of tracks, her husband believes there could have been two sets as he states stride was about 8' while she said 6' which could indicate two or multiple paths it took. He says there were multiple sized prints, but pretty close in size One of the guys went back the next day and the tracks had washed away. When I went to the site with the couple, I began to appreciate how remote this part of the lake is. It took us about 45 minutes to paddle up the lake channels to get to the head of the lake where a small stream feeds the lake. Kiley and Lynnette showed me approximately where the elk tracks and the unknown tracks came off the bank and meandered up the shallow lake. The possible tracks followed the approximate three elk track ways the entire way except for a couple of instances where it veered off to the east for some reason, then it returned to the elk tracks. Kiley believes he recalls two tracks, one larger than the other. Lynette believes there was only one. Back to the veering off. When the tracks veered off they went over to what appeared to be a birds nest under water. There were what looked like egg shells in these dug outs in the mud. The tracks did go around these mud holes. On the way up the lake I saw white shells along the shore and I considered they could be fresh water mussels, however upon inspection, they were goose eggs or the like in the muddy bank. We saw more in the water as well. We found it odd that they were under water but I did learn the water levels change seasonally and perhaps the year they had come here, the water had been lower in the spring, low enough for goose nests to be in the muddy shores. However I still cannot rule out that something was digging for freshwater mussels, but they have yet to be confirmed at this lake. The other bit of additional information I gathered from them during the second interview on site was that Kylie believes he could make out the toes in the prints, this interests me because the next day, they say their friend could barely distinguish the tracks due to the flow of the river into the lake, they were washing away. To me this indicates the trackway was created the same day and perhaps very recent to their arrival. We paddled further up stream to a waterfall and there is a horse trail that we believe comes from Quinn Meadow horse camp. We will be camping along the shores of this lake, perhaps in September to try to recreate the scene. They were not true believers until coming across this trackway. They have considered all options for what could have created these prints and land at the same conclusion I do, Bigfoot tracks.",yes,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=36384

His childhood was spent with his older cousin roaming the countryside around the family property on which his mother has lived since 1930 and continues to with his father. The witness has been a hunter since boyhood and is familiar with the local fauna and the sounds they make. He has heard cougars vocalize and mentioned how rare that is. The witness was watching a show about bigfoot on the History Channel when BFRO.net was mentioned, so he visited the web site. He came across the Snohomish recording which struck a nerve and thought instantly, “That’s IT!” The shiver it sent up his spine prompted him to send in the report. Over the years, he has attempted to describe the vocals he and his family heard that night. He shared a quick, funny anecdote about coming within twenty yards of a grizzly without realizing it until the bear announced itself with a growl and a huff. When his girlfriend asked what had made the noise he said, “ A bear: we got to get out of here.” What he was thinking was, “That’s not IT.” I found it amusing that he had an encounter with a big bear and almost instantly thought of the vocalization from all those years ago. On a summer evening in 1977 the witness (age: 12) and his older cousin (age: 17) were walking home after playing in a hayfield until dusk. The distance between the two is three quarters of a mile. About half way there they were both startled by a loud whooping. They paused to listen and after the second whoop began to run. The quality of the sound, ”made the blood run cold….IT was disturbing…the feeling was instinctual…I’ve never run so fast in my life.” The vocalizing continued until they were inside the house. There they eventually convinced his “incredulous parents” to step outside to listen to the vocals. Until that point the couple had supplied the young men with every possible explanation for the noise...cougar, elk etc. The witness explained to them that it sounded like a gibbon he had both seen on TV’s Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom and heard at the zoo. Once outside, all was quiet. He remembers distinctly his father standing and listening until he said, “I’ve had enough.” Just as he turned to go inside, the whooping began again and continued for some time. “That really disturbed my mother and that isn’t easy; she’s an old farm gal.” She walked inside and while the animal continued to call, an old high school friend and trapper for the county. She told him that “something was out here and he needed to come and check it out.” After the vocals stopped, his cousin wished to go home but did not care to walk, despite the fact that it was only across the road, so he called his parents for a ride. Because they refused, the witness’ father drove the teenager home in his pickup. The two boys did not venture from the farm for weeks following this event. Nothing was found by the trapper who arrived three days later. The vocalizations were five to eight seconds long with a pause of ten to fifteen seconds between them. Those on the first night lasted over a half hour, possibly longer. The witness reports that everyone could easily tell where the sound originated and all four were impressed; no one present had heard anything like it, before or since. “It was not from a small animal.” The vocalizations continued the following two nights lasting up to, or over an hour per episode from the same spot on the mountain near some old growth firs that are no longer there. The witness states, “ I got the impression that it was looking for a response and didn't get one and moved on, or that it was announcing its presence.” I found this witness credible. I believe the vocals’ timbre and volume described are consistent with other alleged sasquatch vocals.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=22570

We spent 3 weeks in the state and I was lucky enough to see what I think was Bigfoot. We had camped in an area that was dense and close to a shallow river. It was almost like the camp was a bald spot with a wall of brush and trees around it. There was a trail that led to the shallow river and although it probably wasn't far, seemed so to me. The late afternoon was sunny and warm and everyone but my cousin, my uncle, and myself went to look for herds of elk or antelope. We had campers to sleep in, and my uncle and my cousin were both napping when this sighting occured. I was outside one of the campers playing when I heard a rustling of underbrush.I never smelled anything that I can remember, or heard a sound other than the rustling. When I looked up, I noticed that a small sapling...maybe the size of the end of a baseball bat, just bent completely over.This sapling was behind a thick wall of what appeared to be some sort of a berry bush. I am not sure what kind, though. I was curious and walked over to where I had seen the sapling bend over, thinking that there was a squirrel hanging on to it or something. That is when a large hand reached out from behind this brush and grabbed a handful of berries. I had to be 8 or 10 feet away at the time. The hand was huge with long reddish brown hair. It was clear that it was a hand and NOT a paw. I stood there in total shock.When I managed to run, I ran for my life. It did not chase me or anything, but I saw all that I wanted to see of it. The hand was scary enough, I probably would have died of fright had I seen the rest of it. I got back into camp which was not far away, but far enough for my napping cousin and uncle not to hear anything. I never screamed or made a sound, I just ran and sat as close to that camper as I could. I realized when I sat down in the fine dirt that I had wet my shorts.I was 7 years old and I had never done that before! I kept my mouth shut until my Mother and my other uncles and aunts (That were from Oregon) got back from antelope/elk sightseeing. I told them everything and they told me that it had to have been a bear. I described the color of the hair and I was told that it must have been black hair that I had seen, because this area only had black bears. I wasn't stupid. I knew the difference between a hand and a paw and the difference between reddish brown and black. I managed to let them convince me that it must have been a bear and we left and came back to our home state of Mississippi. A few years later I was in 6th grade. We had a library period and we could look for and check out books. I found a book with a black cover and if I am not mistaken, the title was ""Bigfoot"". I hurried to check this book out and read it from cover to cover. It wasn't until that moment that I figured out that the animal that I had seen those years earlier had a name. I had never been so excited in my life! Ever since, I have been interested in all sightings, shows, books, etc. of the Bigfoot/Sasquatch/Yeti/Skunkape. I have thought about telling my story for years, but I, like everyone else, have been afraid of the teasing and skeptisism of others. My family says ""We believe that YOU believe what you saw."" I will believe it until the day I die. I am 29 now and I hope that the mystery will be solved in my lifetime. My husband and my son believe me more than my Mom, Dad, Aunts, Uncles and cousins. I am very genuine and honest and I would never lie about something like that.

We did not have a campfire due to the dry conditions. I was sound asleep when I felt something touching my beard. (I had a very heavy beard/mustache and long hair at this time). It was gently rubbing fingers through my beard, not as if it was intending to wake me, only trying to figure out who or what I was. I would liken it to a blind person touching the contours of your face to try and ""see"" you. For some reason I was thinking of a squirrel or other critter. I did noticed an odor like burnt hair and decomposing meat. Very strong. I sat up and roared to spook whatever it was, away.

I can still clearly see the beast. I was about 15 and my friend & I went hiking in the hills between these two neighboring towns of Sutherlin & Oakland, Oregon. It was in the fall, I believe we were just about to go back to school for the year. It was a pretty warm day. We stopped along the way to take a restroom break. We were on some logging roads, or they may have just been fire control roads put there by the BLM, but anyway we were on a curve in the road. We knew there were probably other people in the area, and so we each posted a 'watch-out' while the other of us did our business. Anyway, I was watching out for her, and walked a little way back down the road the way we had just come... when I heard a noise. I looked up just in time to see what I thought must have been a bear. It was just across a clearing across the road coming down a very steep embankment. It was near the top, very dark brown or black in color and was crashing down the embankment through some smaller trees, in an upright position. I know it was not a man. It did not have clothes on or anything like that. It was big and hairy. it started from the top of the steep embankment and crashed downwards almost in our direction. I could hear the thump thump thump thump of its steps very clearly along with all the crashing of the brush. It was doing this in an upright position taking huge steps as one would if you were walking down a steep hill very quickly. I was stunned for a moment, then I screamed, and it stopped and looked in my direction, I ran... my girlfriend was still around the corner and she screamed too... I was yelling bear! bear! bear! and we both hurried off in the other direction. She asked me what I saw and I told her; we speculated on it for much of the rest of our long hike. I had convinced myself that it must have been a bear. Later that night I told my father about our close call with the bear and when I told him what I had saw and what it did... he told me it must have been a man because bears did not ever walk upright and definitely not upright down a hillside. that is when I came to the conclusion that it must have been a big foot.",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"dark brown , black",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,running down hill,NA,running,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=3295

We headed for the state of Oregon in August 1979 for a possible long term stay. After a 5-day drive we came to the small town of Drain, Oregon, where Jimmy had been a few years earlier with his ex-wife and child. After about 3 weeks we settled in and everything was looking pretty good for us. A couple of months passed by and one early morning in October 1979 I got up and asked my brother Jimmy if he knew of a place to go deer hunting. He told me that he had been to a place a few years ago just outside a small town called Yoncalla, Oregon, a few miles south of Drain on HWY 99. So we took off to go check out the area he told me about. We drove south of yoncalla about 2-3 miles and turned to the west on an old logging road. We went up the road for about 2 miles and came to a fork in the road, at that time I ask Jimmy, do I go right or left? He told me it doesn't matter. So I turned right and the road ended at the top of a mountain about 2 more miles up. The road that turned left at the fork ended at the top of a mountain about 300-500 yards away to be left. Jimmy and I got out of the car for a nature call, after about 20 seconds Jimmy told me to look over on the other mountain top, he saw something move. I looked and I told him that I didn't see anything. About 10 seconds later Jimmy told me, look I saw something move! I looked and told him that, I.., and that's all I could say. At that time we saw a BIG black thing walking like a man. It walked over to the edge of the other mountain, the mountain we would have been on if we had taken a left at the fork in the road. It was standing there for about 10-20 seconds before it walked back to where we first saw it. When it stopped, it turned and looked at us for about 30 seconds, then turned away. That's when we saw a little one standing there beside it. We watched as they walked away from us over the mountain. They were about 300 to 500 yards away from us; the big one was about 6-7 feet tall and about 300-400 pounds; very muscular. The smaller one was about 4-5 feet tall and probably about 100 to 150 pounds. After we got over the shock, Jimmy and I left and drove down to the fork in the road and saw a man on a horse. We stopped and asked the man if his horse was acting funny or if he saw anything strange? He pulled out a BIG pistol and told us he was not worried about it. I think that the Big Foot was looking at him, when it walked over to the side of the mountain and looked down. We stopped in the town of Yoncalla to get something to drink and told some of the people there and they did not care to talk about it, so we left. I hope you take this story seriously, because you are the first that I've told it to in a long time. I have always wondered why me, why did I see it. Charles A.

It then became clear that the animals were not elk or bear. The animals were tall, very muscular, and walked as a wrestler would. The larger one had arms longer than a man's and very muscular. The younger/smaller one was only a little lighter in color than the other. Both were very dark with the larger one near black in color. Both had rounded heads, like a human.

Over the years there are several incidents that stand out in my mind, but the one(s) that prompted me to write you occured during my stay in the summer of 1989. Two of my cousins and I were up very late watching some movies. When the movies were over, we decided to go outside and goof around. As we were running out the door, a strange sound stopped us in our tracks. It was coming from the creek bottom and made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. It began to sound as if a cow was beying, a very deep gutteral sound advancing into a howl that lasted about 5-10 seconds. At first I was dismissing it as one of the neighbors cows, but my cousin said she had never heard it before and the end of the vocalization sounded more like a wolf than a cow. I yelled for my younger cousin to come back inside, she had frozen in place when the sound started, and we locked the door - something that they never do because the location is so rural. I had never been so frightened by a noise in my life. What ever it was sounded very large and I was in doubt that the locked door would stop it if it decided to investigate it's surroundings. It sounded very close, but we were located in a valley, and because of the echo it was hard for me to figure out exactly how close it really was. Two nights later I heard it again, this time I was alone on the dirt road that connects the ""highway"" to the properties on the Mountain. I was walking to the bridge that covers a creek that seperates the properties when I heard it again, starting low and growing to a high-pitched howl. I froze and waited, it sounded again a few minutes later, closer than before.

The girls heard something large walking in the same direction they were, but hidden about eight feet up into the treeline. The road was a narrow, two lane dirt road, surrounded on both sides by steep wooded hills. They noted that whatever was walking, would stop and start walking as they did. The cousin became very frightened, yelled ""Bear!"" and started running for home. The cousin reached home well ahead of witness and the witness heard her uncle calling for her. He was afraid she would run into the bear. The witness made it home without further incident, but feels strongly that it was not a bear following them that day.

It was approximately 2:30 am, on a Saturday morning. I was driving south on Interstate-5 and it was raining lightly. The area is known as Rice Hill, about a half hour north of Roseburg, Oregon. Heading south, the highway runs up rice Hill, sweeps to the west across the top, and then turns back to the south as it drops off. As I crested the hill, and was exiting the the turn to the west, my headlights came level with the road and the guard rail, along the turn to the south. Right at the point of curve, of the turn to the south, right next to the guard rail, was a bigfoot. It was crouched down, kind of squatting, like a baseball catcher, untill my headlights were right on it, and then it stood up, quickly, took a step or two and jumped the guard rail, and went down the enbankment. At 65 mph, I didn't see it for long, especially at night; however, there is no doubt that it was the stereotypical bigfoot. Needless to say, I was quite surprised, and I pulled over.

Its ability to jump a guard rail in two steps was not anything a bear could do. It didn't seem huge to me, however, when I stand next to a guard rail, it comes up to the top of my knee (I'm 5'8""), so it must have easily been in the 6'+ range.

At the time of the encounter, she had gone for a casual walk late in the day near the base of a small forested mountain just north of her family's property. It was still warm after a hot day in August. She heard rustling around in the brush just ahead and directly to her left. Seconds later, she was stunned to see a very tall, hirsute, dark-colored biped step out into a tiny clearing 20-30 yards in front of her and look at her ""dead in the eyes"" with what she interpreted to be a ""sinister"" type look. The witness took a step back and the creature slowly turned and departed back inside the tree line. She further elaborated on the subject's appearance and described it as looking very ape-like in both its discernable facial characteristics (dark gorilla-like facial skin) and muscular upper body that was ""very buff."" The animal appeared bipedal and human-like, except for being covered in very dark brown, ""almost black"" hair. She also described the subject's head as being average-size in relationship to the body and “round” on a short, almost absent neck. She estimated the animal's height as being close to 8 feet. It stood with a slight slouch; the lower limbs seemed proportional to the subject's size and stature, but the arms appeared ""a little lengthy.” During the 15-20 second encounter, the witness also described a strong, foul-smelling odor that she later concluded was similar to that of a skunk but much stronger. After the subject disappeared inside the tree line, the witness – quite shaken up – retreated towards her residence at a very brisk pace. She was reluctant to return to the location, but did so several days after the encounter. In regards to the faint ""footprint"" mentioned, when the witness returned to the site, she retraced the path the animal took and found an indentation which appeared to have the outline of a single, large and bare footprint with 5 toes. She was not able to find any other track impressions. She believes with its size and estimated stride it could've easily stepped over a nearby fence into thick vegetation along any point of the brush-concealed fence line. Five and a half years later and now a senior in high school, her and her family still reside on the same property. Although she's heard of other bigfoot sightings in the Callahan range, and the towns of Tenmile, Lookingglass and Glide (northeast of Roseburg), she hasn't experienced any other bigfoot activity around the family property. On several occasions she has heard strange, howling vocalizations late at night. She can't be certain these were bigfoot sounds, but they were unusual enough for her to take notice. Note on the region: The Callahan Mountains are a series of small, crag-like forested mountains overlooking the Flournoy Valley west of the town of Roseburg. Due to the diversity in both climate and soil, this scenic southwest Oregon valley is considered historic wine country and is made up of a series of interconnecting small mountain ranges and valleys including both the Klamath & Cascade Mountains, as well as the Coast Range (further west). Although this area is heavily logged with many clear-cuts, there continues to be a consistent history of reported bigfoot sightings by locals in the densely forested sections of the mountains and logging roads. It's also worth noting that coincidentally, several months before this witness' report submission to the BFRO, fellow BFRO researcher Cliff Barackman & myself, while traveling through the state of Oregon, camped within just a few miles of the witness' residence in August of 2007 and spent one uneventful evening there. Interestingly enough, that location was suggested to us by a friendly Oregon Fish & Game Warden we met at a Roseburg service station earlier in the day. He also kindly shared with us several detailed and recent bigfoot encounters he was personally aware of.",NA,yes,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=22996

I got out of my truck with my flashlight in hand and started walking back toward the ""man"". I was working the lightbeam along the fenceline when I heard the most godawful sound I've ever heard in my life! I froze. I was in the military and I work as a psychiatric nurse and I don't scare easily but that scream scared the crap out of me. It sounded like a dying calf in a hail storm..It was ranging in tone, starting out high pitched, then ending up as a threatening, low pitched, guttural sound. I dropped my flashlight and RAN back to my truck and spun tires getting out of there. The next day on my way to work, I stopped at the same spot. My flashlight was still there. I didn't notice any footprints but did see the tall grass had been walked through on the other side of the fence. I looked on all the fence posts in the area where I saw it but did not see any evidence of hair. As to what it looked like, I only got a brief look as I went by, but it had to be at least 7 foot tall. I base this on the fact that I drive a Dodge Ram truck; when I'm sitting in the driver's seat, my head is 6 feet off the ground. The spot where this thing stood is in a depression in the ground. When I park my truck in that spot and stand where it stood, I can't see into the cab at all. And yet, that night I saw it, its head was even with mine, I was looking directly out the window not slightly up or down. I couldn't make out features as it was dark but the lights of my pickup slightly illuminated the area where it stood as I went by. As I said, I thought it was a man at first who needed help. It looked so human at that moment, it wasn't until later that I came to believe it couldn't have been a man. No man could have made that sound. What I remember seeing was a figure standing next to the fence. Its head followed me as I went by. It didn't appear to have shoulders, it looked like the head just spread out until it became shoulders. It appeared to have long hair all over; at first I thought it was a long jacket like a duster, but as I look back it had to be fur. But it was the scream that stands out in my mind. It was like a warning, ""don't come closer"", at least that was the message I got!",1,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,standing on side of road with arm on fence post,NA,NA,NA,scream,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,The site of the observation is about a mile south of the North Umpqua River.

We pulled into a forest Service campground named Eagle Rock and found we were the only ones in the campground. The campground is situated right alongside what I believe is the Umpqua River. There are steep mountains on both sides so I guess you would say we were at the bottom of a canyon. The water was running over a lot of rocks next to our site and made a lot of noise. My brother decided to pitch his tent next to the river and I slept in my van in the parking spot. As darkness fell, we sat out in the dark talking about our lives. This was the first time we had been together in about 20 years so we had a lot of stories to tell. While we were was talking,I heard something making a weird calling noise from the mountain across the river from us. I wasn't sure until I heard it a second time. Since my brother was talking at the time, he didn't hear it. We eventually headed off to our respective beds. My brother woke up at 0200. He said he was checking his watch fo the time when he heard 2 loud hoots from across the river about 50-100 yards downstream. He called them hoots but said it wasn't really a hoot. He couldn't really describe or imitate the sound. They had to be very loud to be heard over the noise of the river. He laid frozen in his sleeping bag then heard something walking around the campsite. About that time something woke me up. I heard something moving around outside the van and was about to raise the windowshade to peek out when I heard what sounded like a gorilla grunting next to my van. I have no real experience with gorillas and have only heard them on nature shows on TV, but that's what I heard. Needless to say I was too afraid to lift the shade at that point. After a while, it got quiet (except for the river noise) and somehow we both fell back asleep. When it finally got light we came out, compared notes and started looking for any tracks. The ground was too hard and the river too rocky to show us any. I also checked the campground to see if there were any other campers there, but there were none. We don't think it could have been deer or elk because it was right in the middle of hunting season and hunters are all over the place up there. I don't think any deer or elk would come into a human camp at that time of year. When we got home we listened to the recordings on the site.

My wife and I were in, I believe, Union County, Oregon, where I was elk hunting. I hunted alone because too many hunters like to ride all day and I like to walk the high country. I carried a CB radio so I could stay in contact with the wife and kids. After driving to the high country I would have my wife drive back down and I would hunt the ridges and if necessary call and have her move my truck to another location as I hunted my way along the high ridges. On this day it was beautiful, clear cool, and sunny. I had a small breeze coming toward me as I walked along a high ridge. As I came down into a saddle where there were about 3"" diameter saplings on both sides of the ridge, the path in front was clear on top for a long ways and about 30 feet wide. Vision was great. As the ground became level at the bottom of the saddle there was a single pine tree about 9 feet tall in the middle standing by itself. From about thirty, maybe forty feet away, I noticed what appeared to be a tall stump or object standing on the other side of the tree. The saplings on each side of this ridge had leaves still on so you could only see throught them to about three feet up. I still had my rifle slung on my back as stopped to view the dark object on the other side of the lone pine tree. I watched it and decided after a minute or so it was not a deer or elk and decided maybe a old tree stump with the top broken off about 5 feet tall. I then squatted down and was looking under the saplings to see if I could spot any part of an elk through the underside of the saplings. I first looked right and then turned to my left and suddenly I spotted movement from the right corner of my eye and I jerked around, peering back toward the pine tree. I saw the object was gone and as I swung to the right I saw two brown legs to the waist through the saplings running as fluid and fast as any thing I have ever seen. I heard nothing. I immediately ran to my left and down along the side of the saplings and in about a hundred yards the saplings ended and I had a expansive view of the side of the ridge. I was amazed to see nothing. It was as though whatever I saw disapppeared into shale rock slopes down the ridge..with no noise I could detect. I was breathing hard but stopping long enough to listen..still ..nothing. I hunted on out the ridge about another 3 miles and then dropped off the side as evening was approaching. I asked my wife who was on the only road in if she had seen any hunters in the area and she said no hunters or camps. The road dead ends at a fire lookout. I have concluded after thinking about this over the years that what ever I saw was intelligent (it froze until it knew I was looking away). If it had tried to move from behind the tree, I would have been able to see it very clearly. It waited for probably one to two maybe even three minutes while I studied the area without moving. But as soon as I looked off to my extreme left, it ran across the 12' clearing. After swinging to my right still on my haunches, I had a clear view of the legs running to know it was on two legs with brown smooth looking fur. It ran quietly but fast and unbelievably quiet. I'm guessing 5 feet tall; there was no smell as the breeze was in my face while it was directly in front of me. I still don't know about there being a bigfoot but I cannot explain what I know I saw that day. I hunted New York , California and Montana years prior to this and am considered a knowledgeable hunter. I have played this over in my head many times since and I still wonder??.

It was evening time,a late summer afternoon. I was six years old at the time. I was outside talking to my stepbrother who was working on our pick up truck. Well I noticed someone standing atop the hill across the road. At first I thought who was that lady at that time of day?, I assumed at that time because I saw long dark brown reddish hair lit by the setting sun behind her. Then I noticed its entire silhoutte was covered with hair, not just the head. I stared at it for a good minute or so, as it just stood there. I knew then it was a bigfoot that my folks told me about. It turned and started walking away. As it dissappeared I ran into the house and was yelling to everyone what I had just seen. Parents went up top the hill and found large foot prints. That happened late summer in 1976 in Canyon City Oregon. Story 2. I had another experience traveling through the Three Sisters Mountain Range between Bend and Eugene Oregon. It was late that fall about the same year 1976. We were on our way to Eugene,me,my mother, and step brother. I had to take a leak and we were up on the mountain so I asked them to pull over because I couldn't hold it any more and had to go. Well they pulled over and I got out and was in the process of going when I looked down I saw a foot print beside the road, a bare foot, no shoes on. I noticed there were several prints from the road going into the woods. I got scraed ran back to the car and jumped into the front seat of the car. I specifically remember saying lets get the hell outta here I just saw some bigfoot tracks. They wanted to see, so I had to let my mom out, so we looked at them together and found footprints in the sandy dirt roughly the size of a mans. I have been told by my mother, of loud screams that were loud,gutteral sounds, and somewhat raspy. Also in Canyon City. She also described them as being like the creature was in a deep sorrowful pain, as it sounded to her. I also had friend that moved from Michigan that he and his folks seen one standing in the middle of the road one night, described it as a large hair covered creature that looked like a man, he referred to it as a bigfoot. I have another story told to me by my grand mother in Yreka California. She was living in her cabin in the forest when one night she saw a bigfoot peering at her through the window. She said that it must see in the dark because its eyes were lit up like that of a deers in the head lights and that the color of them were blue. She said she was not afraid of it.

I don't remember whether or not I completed it or not , so here it is again. Back in the summer of 1997 or '98, about July 4th, if I recall correctly, my wife and I had decided to go camping for a couple of days, we loaded up the camper. Big creek is where we liked to go. We lived in a little town called Long Creek in eastern Oregon and Big Creek isn't really that far. It's 14 miles to the Middle Fork of the John Day River and then upstream another25 or so miles on a county road. Then you turn up the Big Creek Road and go another 6 miles. Anyway, that will get you in the area of our encounter. We had gone to bed about 10. I was asleep when my wife woke me up to listen to a strange noise she had been hearing for over an hour or so.Well, I listened for a little while and didn't hear anything and was trying to get back to sleep. All the sudden I heard what she had been hearing. I've been in the woods my whole life hunting, fishing cutting firewood, not to mention the years I've spent hauling logs out of the woods. I'll tell you what that was the strangest sound I had ever heard. Almost like a screaming howl. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. My wife said that it was moving around us, because she had heard it in 4 different spots since the first time she heard it.She said it sounded closer now than the time before. Needless to say, we were both wide awake by this time and then it screamed again and it was in a new spot. Either it moved around or there were more than one. We were just lying there with the window open staring into the dark. It was a little cloudy so not much light out, but we were still trying to see something. All this time our two brave dogs that normally bark at everything were hiding under the table, shaking. No matter what we did they wouldn't move. Then it screamed again and it sounded really close and loud. I got out of bed and grabbed the gun, a. 22 , that almost made me feel worse. Anyway, we loaded up right then. My wife held the gun and flashlight, while I got out of the camper as I'm disabled and then I held the light & pea shooter while she tried to hurry and put every thing inside. To sum up that part, we left. When we got home we went straight to bed in the morning. We found out that one of the dogs was so scared she pooped on herself in the camper. She has never done anything like that before or since. We just kind of didn't talk about it too much until that show came on, Mysterious Encounters. You played a recording of a bigfoot and when we heard it it sent goosebumps over my skin and my hair stood up again and so did my wife's. That's the same sound we had listened to that night.Oh, by the way, it was about 2AM when I first heard it but my wife said she had been listening to it for well over an hour.

I jumped up and started following it; I couldn't see it but I could here it crashing through the brush. I got down to the bottom of the hill were there was a clearing.

The little brother was actually totally terrified to the point of tears of what he had seen. The third event consisted of ca. 5 branches thrown at the witness in about a 40' to 50' long arc, though he heard nothing else other than some minor growls out of the forest. Aside from that, he mentioned that he had often heard the sounds of wood being banged together in the forest.

I was very tempted to phone, but just couldn't. I have thought about my encounter quite often, with no one to share it with. About a year ago we purchased a computer. I have been learning how to use it along with the internet.This is were I came across your web site. I have read a lot of the posted sightings. Report #5473 had one similarity to what occured on a logging site in Oregon, year 1968. I contacted your site and inquired if you were interested in a sighting this old. Two researchers contacted me via email with an encouraging yes. At the time of the encounter I was 18 years old. I was working for a company out of Eugene Oregon. My job was to install radio signialing equipment on logging equipment. These logging sites were sometimes close to cities and more often quite distant. It was summer 1968 with real nice weather. This job was located around 40 to 50 miles north east of Estacata Oregon in the cascade mountains south of Mount Hood, elevation around 3500 feet.. I arrived on site long after the logging crew had left for the day. I estimate the time at 19:30 Hrs. The Radio was to be installed on a yarder. This machine has spools that hold cable that is used to bring logs to a central point, commonly called a landing. This macine is bolted down on two logs that are about three feet in diameter and fifty feet long.I estimate the weight of this machine to be 45 tons. The running board which the operator stands on is around 2 to 21/2 feet above ground level. When the operator stands looking to the other side,he can just see over the haulback drum (spool). I set up my generator and started work. As time went on it became very dark. No moon and very dark! Around 22:30 hrs the hair stood up on the back of my neck. I knew I was being watched. Up until this time I had no indication of any thing out of the ordinary. This job had to be 35 miles from the nearest known person. I took down my drop light and directed it to a location directly behind me. I saw eyes looking directly at me. The only thing I could see were those eyes staring at me. We looked at each other for maybe 15 seconds. It then turned to its right and I could not see it any longer. I knew I needed to get out of there as soon as possible.I continued work at a faster pace! About ten miniutes later I smelled a repulsive odor. A light breeze was blowing from the other side of the yarder. At this point I wasn't sure what to do. My light was hanging on the roof support to my left. I slowly turned it to the direction of the smell, about 20 feet away across the haulback drum were those eyes again, but now I could make out the shape of a large animal, Black in color and very wide. I also noticed that under the eyes seemed to be shiny. The car was 20 to 30 feet away and down slope from me. I decided it was time to leave and return in the morning. The generator was small and normally easy to carry, running it was quite difficult. I managed to get to the car with a running generator and light. I shut down the generator and drove about 5 miles away and awaited daylight. I woke to the sound of the crew bus going by. I followed them back to the job and completed the installation. We tested the system and they went to work. I took a look around for footprints, but with all of the limbs and brush I was not able to find any. The chaser asked me why I was parked so far away. I told him my story. His reaction told me I was not the only one to see this animal. He pointed out two 55 gallon barrels that were carried up a log pile and tossed over the side of the landing. These barrels were full and weighed approximatly 475lbs. This animal had to have great strength to accomplish this, thus report #5473. I will admit I was terrified, I think the gererator attracted its attention. It never came any closer than 20 feet and never made a sound. I installed many more radio systems after this and many were at night, but never saw or herd any thing again.",1,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,black,NA,NA,golden,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,shiny eyes,NA,"staring at witness , large 400+ pouinds barrels tossed",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"Here is a little more detail the witness was able to provide: ""It's size was great, I could only make out It's black shape slightly, shoulders up. I think the smell was similar to a wet dog that had rolled in something dead, but the machine had a distinct diesel and oil smell as well. I think the change in smell alerted me to something across from me."" The witness recalls the color of the eyes as a bit golden, though he mainly remembers them as being very bright. Like, in his wording, ""a cat's eyes."" In conversation with me, he estimated the height of the creature to be approximately eight feet. He remembers the weather conditions that day as warm and clear. There was no moon that night. He feels that the sighting occurred in August. Briefly, two things I would like to note: First, this is a very good example of a report on the cusp of being a Class A or a Class B sighting. It has been filed as Class B only because there was no clear visual of the creature. Second, I would like to say that, yes, BFRO would like to hear about older reports. Reports such as this provide useful, long-term information on a given area, showing sasquatch presence over time and possibly behavior patterns within a given area. No one with a thirty-year-old sighting should shy away from reporting it to us, as it could well prove quite useful.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=5816

It was 1970. My Dad stuck me on a huge stump and went off to my right and our neighbor, W. went off to my left. The stump partially embraced me like a recliner. It was huge! Also, it as a good place to sit for a long time. My view was a meadow and heavy brush. Large Douglas Firs bodered the area...perhaps 3 acres. This was back when large fir trees still existed and these were being logged in abundance. I had never heard of Bigfoot, read anything about him or had any idea what so ever that such things existed in the woods. I am very comfortable in the woods. Evidently, I was trusted by my father and neighbor as they left me with a 303 British. Ok.... Big deal. After about 2 hours later I hear a rustle to my right. I click off my safety and slowly move my gun and body to see. Immediately, I thought it was my father running at full speed through the woods. Odd behavior but I click my safety back on and watched what I thought was my Dad run through the brush. He ran about 50' in front of me from right to left. The heavy brush came up to his breast area. Heavy steam came out in regular intervals as he ran. It was quite a site. I didn't understand why the branches weren't making that scraping noise on his parka. My dad wore a rust color parka popular at the time. One thing he never did was wear the hood. But, it appears as though Dad had his hood on while running though the wood. Odd? My dad was an athelete and physicaly fit most of his life. Played all the sports. I thought he was particularly athletic running though the woods with amazing grace. I sat there ponderng what had just happened when I hear another crashing noise to my right. I look and there is dad, stomping through the woods making all kinds of noise. He was still hunting! I was stunned to see him on my right as I just saw him pass from view on my left! Now he looks real tiny and the brush is 1' to 2' over his head. He looks small and weak and definately not athletic. I could hear his every foot step. I'm 15. Too young I think to be scared. I know every type of animal in the woods and am struggling with what I had just seen. The hunt has obviously come to a close as dad is exhausted. Still confused, I said, ""Did you just run by here?"" Dad replies, ""Are you kidding, I can barely stand up out here!"" Then I explained something had run by. I though it was you. Only, when I saw you I realized what I saw was huge,very fast and very powerful. I described to my dad what I had seen. I was not frieghtened. What I saw was an intelligent human looking animal running with purpose, speed, grace and power. The kind you find from creatures in nature. Although he was running fast the noise was minimal. He made less noise running than my dad did walking. About 6 months later I was reading a story in a magazine about some kids in The Dalles, Oregon chasing and shooting a creature. My blood went cold. It was then I realized what I had seen. In the subsequent years I have seen numerous stories on the creature. Science says without proof, they don't exist. Normal people are labled as kooks or they saw a bear, deer or an elk.

When I came to an area that had less undergrowth I saw the tracks I'd been following. They were huge human like footprints, about 1-1/2 times longer than my boots (size 10-1/2) and were spaced farther apart than a human gait. I continued following them with the hair on the back of my neck standing up. Suddenly I saw a red hat. It was my mom, so I signaled for her to come down where I was. I showed her the tracks and she said something like let's get out of here. We followed the tracks a little farther where they crossed the road. Close to where they crossed we found a pile of feces. It resembled bear feces in that it contained berries. At that point we made a B-line for the truck. When we got there I saw my dad and uncle working a brushy draw, apparently they had seen a deer. I went up the hill towards them through an old burn area and came upon another set of the tracks. I left my orange hat there to mark the spot. When my dad and uncle came down I showed them the tracks. They both agreed they were way to big to be bear tracks. When we left down the road, we showed them where the other tracks crossed the road.

We crested a point of the hwy.when we seen brake lights and swerving in front of us so we slowed thinking it must be an animal or a wreck up ahead. when we got to the area of the braking we noticed a probable person running with arms swinging along the divide between the two directions of travel. My first impression was that it was someone wearing a fur type coat with a hood as I could see the wet hair. My father was in the outside lane and there was a car in the inside lane, the car ahead and inside slamed on the brakes as the figure crossed in front of their car, and my father also slowed way down. At this time the figure crossed in front of our car and my father says he felt the car hit the lower portion of the leg and made eye to eye contact with it. At that time it started to run along the outside lane still with the flow of traffic, at that time we came up to it's side. I was in the passenger side of the car and looked up at this figure as we commensed to pass. My wife was in the rear passenger window and my mother in the center of the front seat. I looked straight into his face at about 3-4 feet, and saw a look of total fright and terror in it's eyes. At that moment it made a 90 degree turn away from our oncoming car and right into the rear drivers side of an oncoming pickup with a camper on it and literally bounced off the rear corner of the camper and up about a 60 degree incline and into the trees. When I got home I called the State Patrol and asked where I was to report an unusual sighting, and he asked me if I thought It was a UFO, I told him no and he said a Bigfoot, I said well something like that. He told me to call the shariff of the county in which it happened and I did. When I called them I went through the same conversation. I told him the facts as I knew them. He knew I was a little aprehensive, and told me not to feel aprehensive about turning in the sighting as he had taken quite a few reports that night on the same sighting and four of those where police officers. This report was taken by Peter Byrns and Barbara Wasson with NASI.
