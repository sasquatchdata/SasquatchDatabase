Though it was illegal to snowmachine in Anchorage, there were some good trails to ride on a little north of my house. We took off at probably 11 pm, rode up the road about a quarter mile, and cut off on the trails. It had snowed about 10 inches a few days before so there was fresh snow, with no tracks. I was leading the way for about a half hour, then we stopped and talked for a little bit. We took off again and kept cruising on some sort of game trail that led to an opening in the woods. I rode off into the opening with my friends following about fifty yards behind me. I came over this little mound and saw strange tracks leading to this spot in the snow where it looked like something had pushed aside some snow and layed down. I figured it was just a moose or something. But I followed the tracks over the next small hill and as I came down the far side my headlight pointed right on the back of a bigfoot. It was only about 10 to 12 feet in front of me. It was running in the opposite direction. I slammed on the brakes because I was scared out of my mind. It continued to run away, jumped over a dead log covered in snow and disappeared into a group of trees and into the darkness. I was so surprised and scared I quickly turned around and rode back toward my friends. I met them back by the first mound and said ""We need to get out of here,"" and rode back towards my house. When I told them about it back near my house, they laughed and told me it was probably a bear or someone in the woods. But I was 100% positive that is was not a bear or anything else. The way it was running through the deep snow made me sure that it wasn't anything human.

I didn't think much of it, as me and my friend have done it many times before. There were four of us, and we set out at about 11 o'clock at night. It was rather dark, but there was light from the moon. The weather was rather cold, as we did this in the winter. The area we walked on was game trails (trails that moose walk on) as well as trails used for mushers, runners, cross country skiiers, and that sort. We had walked about 2 miles from my house to another entrance where most people enter. On the way we had talked about unexplainable events or things such as bigfoot, and UFOs. When we reached the bridge where most people come in, one friend had smoked a cigarette. We then saw a light and decided to go on. On the way back, we heard wild dogs barking wildly, and decided to pick up the speed. It eventually became a sprint, whereafter we walked. When we walked, we continued talking about it. It was then I had realized, some thing had been following us, as well as testing us, or even harassing us. It was much earlier, I just didnt think about it. I had thought it was my friend Warren, who is sometimes clumsy. I had thought it was him who had made noises such as slipping, but it was really something throwing stuff at us. I had realized this about half way back. I asked if Warren kept slipping, when he told me it wasn't, and he thought I could have been pulling a prank. We stopped for a minute to listen when I told the others something strange was going on. We stopped, and shone a flashlight around, hearing noises such as steps, and branches moving and breaking. The leader had thought I had been playing a joke when I told him seriously, I wasn't. He decided to walk behind with me, when something threw snowballs, and nearly hit us on many occasions. It was then he realized that this was no joke, and we picked up a light jog, for most of the way. When we were almost out of the woods, we had again heard dogs, and maybe 20 ft away, the branches breaking, and again, something throwing stuff at us. By the time we left, it was about 3-3:30 in the morning. I did not go directly to my house because I didn't know if it was still following us. I know this was not a prank because the snow is more then 5 ft deep in the woods, and someone would have a extremely hard time to play a prank like that.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"throwing snowballs , branch breaking , stalking",NA,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,"Chugach Mountains, moon 85% full",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=8792

Every year after fishing, I try to take a trip up river with a friend or two to wind down and enjoy ourselves before we go home. This year while I was on this trip into Alaska's interior our main mission was to take pictures of bears and the surrounding wildlife to promote a new bear viewing and sports fishing buisness. While on our five day trip, we spotted more than fourty bears. I took hundrends of pictures of these bears and their tracks. One of which, was so big, it put chills up my spin and gave me and my companions a very uneasy sense of insecurity. What set this track apart from the others was it's enormous size and human shape. In one of the pictures that I took of this track, I placed my foot next to it on the ground, keep in mind I am wearing a size 13 boot. Whatever made this track was so heavy, heavier than the biggest bear, that it pushed the gravel so far into the earth that it made us truly speculate what we were looking at. Other pictures that we took of bear tracks were nowhere close to the indentation that this track had left. One of the most intriguing things about this track was there were no visible claw marks as with all the other bear tacks. Both of us felt extremely uneasy of our surroundings and had the feeling that we were being watched. For the rest of the day we didn't have much to talk about, and that night felt uncomfortable at camp. We never heard or smelt anything out of the ordinary. To this day I'm not too sure what we saw and I'm not making any claims other than the words I have put fourth.

It was on the base of a steep mountainside in bare, rocky terrain, with snowfields descending down the small gullies on the hillside. It was moving up the valley about a half mile away. When it crossed the snow, you could plainly see that it was not a bear. It walked upright with long strides and arms swinging and moved fast across the white snow. It was dark in color like a bear. I have seen bears many times since in the same type of terrain and they do not move like this did. It was too big and fast to be a human. Bears can and do walk upright, usually for short instances when they need to see or smell something and need the height. They don't travel in this manner and not in difficult terrain.

Although it's quite close to the Fairbanks area and there are many houses and roads in the main part of Goldstream, the side valleys are still as wild as they were a thousand years ago. I was hunting ruffed grouse in one if these side valleys (I prefer not to say which one). I was on a south-facing aspen covered hillside, and had hunted all afternoon and evening, intending to spend the night out on the hill and hunt my way back in the morning. As I was making camp, a black bear almost walked right into me. I heard him coming from a ways off, and scared him away before he got closer. later on, it will become apparent why I mention this. So I was sleeping out in the open, no tent, under a spruce tree. Sometime in the middle of the night, I was awakened by something prowling around my camp, maybe thirty feet or so away from me, walking in a circle. I mentioned the bear before. . . this was not a bear I heard in the night. My father is a hunting guide, and I literally grew up hunting bears. I KNOW what a bear sounds like when it's walking. Whatever this thing was, it was walking on two legs, with a bit of a shuffling sound between each step, like it was dragging its feet a bit. The leaves on the forest floor were dry like potato chips, and it was breaking a lot of branches--I could hear it and follow its movement quite distinctly. I have to say here that I've spent a LOT of time in the Alaskan bush, and have never before or since been truly afraid of anything I've encountered, but I don't mind saying that on that particular night I was literally shaking with fear. It circled my camp for what seemed like hours, but it was probably only five minutes or so. Finally, remembering something I had once read about the Athabascan Indians' beliefs regarding ""woodsmen"", I started talking to it, albeit in a shaky voice, saying I wanted no trouble that night. The thing stopped dead in its tracks, then a few moments later, I heard it trotting downhill, away from me. Talking to such a creature may sound kinda cornball, but all I know is that it worked. I've kicked myself for this many times since, but the next morning, I didn't bother to look for any tracks, hair, etc. I just packed up and resumed my hunting. I had no further trouble with the woodsman. As a final couple of notes, I do recall hearing kind of low muttering sound as it was prowling around me. Also, having since done some reading on Bigfoot sightings, I've noticed that a lot of people report the animal having a strong foul odor to it.

I was heading south on Auburn Dr toward Farmers Loop which was about 1 mile away. It is a wooded area frequented by homes and in general would be considered a populated area. Houses are on an average of about 100 to 200 feet apart with only the general area around and close to the homes cleared out. Most of the area by far is wooded. It was the section of the road where it passes by Pearl Creek Elementary school. The school can be seen through the woods. Some of the woods in the area are quite thick and in some places can’t be seen into more than about 10 or 15 feet. But in this area, it had apparently been cleaned out quite a bit and sightlines into the section of the sighting were very open. The school and vegetable garden could be seen off to the right from the road I was on. It was about 6pm and I was heading home after a day of working on a deck I was building. The weather was clear with the sun high in the sky. As I was driving, I happened to notice a “man” standing by the right side of the road about 100 yards ahead. It was more of an unconscious recognition. There’s nothing unusual about a man standing on the side of the road in this area. As I got to within about 50 yards, I looked closer. “That’s no man” I said to myself (I was alone in the car). Shortly after that, 1 or 2 seconds, he bolted into the woods towards the school. He did it like a wild animal would do if spooked. I didn’t slow down until I got to the place where I saw him go into the woods which is where I stopped. I could see him running away from the road and when he was into the woods about 30 yards or so, he turned left and was now running parallel to the road in the same direction I was heading. I got a good look at him, but not his face. I could have probably seen his face had I not been so mesmerized and had the presence of mind to look at it. I was busy noticing other things. His fur or hair looked to be about 3 to 4 inches all over the main part of his body. It was a reddish rusty color. I was mildly struck by how red it was, but it definitely had some rustyness to it. He was about 6 feet tall and looked to weigh about 200 lbs. He ran with a strange “Hoppy” kind of run. It wasn’t a limp. With one foot he pushed off with was more a normal running move, but the other foot he pushed off with propelled him upward (about a foot or less) and forward. I watched him until he disappeared into the woods. There was a road about 100 yards ahead and I took off to get to it so I could turn right and in 20 yards turn right again to the road that lead to the school parking lot. So the wooded area he was in was sort of a peninsula and he seemingly had to be in there somewhere. The woods I was looking into from that angle were quite thick and I didn’t see him and haven’t seen him since. A little farther up on the right was the school garden that had people in it (around 7 - 10) which I’m now sorry I didn’t stop to go talk to them about it. The next day as I was driving in to work on the deck, I naturally slowed down in the area I saw him (stopped actually) and was surveying the area when a couple walking their dogs were approaching. I flagged them down and told the story of what happened the evening before and they told me that about a week before they were with their dogs and were on the way other side of the school property by the soccer field and 3 kids came running over to them saying “Did you see the sasquatch, did you see the sasquatch.” They also said that what appeared to be a Dad was with them who didn’t seem to excited about it. My conclusion to whether it was real or not is summed up by saying. “It was either real or there was a man in a VERY, VERY convincing costume.” I reported it to the fish and game office in Fairbanks a couple days later. The person who was taking the report was sort of rolling his eyes through the whole thing as he seemed to be writing it down on a piece of scrap paper-.

It wasn't winter yet, just before a corner, my lights hit something sitting on the yellow line in the middle of the road. The lights to this truck were grossly out of adjustment, so they were pointing right at the thing.

It's head was between it's arms, looking toward the ground It had long, human like hair..at first I thought it was an orangutan, Then I thought to myself, what would an orangutan be doing in the middle of nowhere in Alaska. I've lived here almost all my life and there is no animal like this one..I thought to myself the only way that could have been an orangutan is if there's a circus out here.. I knew that was not a possibility in such a remote area. I drove right next to it and I was at it's level. If I had been going slow, I could have touched it easily. I was freaked out and thought I must be seeing things, maybe I was tired..My friend saw it too, although neither one of us said a word until we reached the gas station in the town of Healy just passed Denali. She said ""Did you see that.."" and I said, ""I thought I was seeing things.."" This spooked us so bad we didn't even say anything to each other about it until we were around people. We have talked about this, and still agree that we saw this thing. We have given up on trying to explain it to anyone else, because no one believes it..We both have decided not to bring it up because no one believes it anyway.

I am 64 years old and have 40+ years in law enforcement, currently serving as chief of police. With hunting season not to open until the day after next, we were in no hurry and enjoyed the evening with a touch of good single malt Irish talking about our past hunts and the one we were about to have. Loyd and Davis would not arrive until the first day of the hunt, presumably because Dave had become domesticate sometime after the previous year’s hunt and had to attend a retirement party before being allowed to leave Valdez for camp. With the evening expended and the toll the day had taken on us we were in our sleeping bags and doubtlessly turning logs into sawdust by 2300 hours. The stove was stoked with fresh firewood and all was good. About 0215 I awoke feeling way too warm, unzipped my bag, slinging the top off, when I heard a resounding crack of wood striking wood, similar to a Louisville Slugger solidly striking a large, sound Birch tree very close to the cabin. There being no one within many miles of us, my attention was immediately focused on the sound. A few seconds later, the sound was repeated, which was to be the pattern for several minutes while I attempted to evaluate it to determine its source. I finally decided to wake Bill saying in just above a whisper, “hey Bill”. He stirred responding with something that sounded like “what” and did not move again for twenty minutes; when he woke up and asked what was going on. In the mean time the commotion stopped when I initially attempted to awaken Bill up and I was sitting on the bunk with my .450 in hand waiting for whatever eventuality might arise. Nearing 0300 hours I finally returned to a sound slumber awaking well into the following morning. With a spot of coffee in our gullets and having explained to Bill the events of the previous night we explored the area of the old village, inclusive of the nearby grave yard, in an effort to find an explanation. We found numerous paths traversing the grassy area around the cabins with a multitude of bedding sites. Never did we find anything that would provide us with an answer to the question of the source of sounds. Explaining this to another friend after our return, with the experience of spending many years living in numerous villages, he asked me if there was a native graveyard nearby.

The area, according to Ed, was known for its concentration of berries and black bears. The salmon run was in the early starting stage. Solid forest was estimated to be about 100 miles away. Ed did not have even a shadow of a doubt about the identity of the animal he had seen, particularly since he had previously hunted many of the large game animals of Alaska. Hair of the described appearance can be estimated to be 18-24"" long. The interest of this sighting with its rather meager contents lies in its geographical latitude. The center of Prince William Sound lies at 60 degree, 40 minutes N. Additional Alaskan sighting reports are to be found in Green (1978), and in an article in the magazine ""Alaska"" of October, 1995, pp. 25-27. Aside from reports in the Alaska Panhandle, e.g., near Hyder, Ward Cove on Prince of Wales Island, and in the Wrangell Narrows (by Bob Titmus himself), all in the vicinity of 56 degrees N., there are scattered sightings farther north. On the Alaska Peninsula, a cluster of sightings have been recorded near Chignik Lake (55 degree, 54 minutes N), Manokotak near Kulukak Bay (58:40 N), Togiak drainage (59 N), Lake Iliamna (59:30 N), and yet farther north near Galena, 120 miles inland from Norton Sound (64:44 N) and Kotzebue Sound at the Arctic Circle (66:33). All of these sites are on the coast or within ready sasquatch walking distance of it and are, consequently, moderated by the ocean. Such cannot be said for inland sightings, such as that near Fort Yukon, south of the Brooks Range, or Dawson Creek (NE British Columbia; detailed in Hunter and Dahinden, 1993). Both of these locations are exposed to the full brunt of the arctic winter. Seasonal migration would appear to be of immediate advantage in these regions as compared to the overall temperate Pacific Northwest, though unlikely to be established in view of the rarity of these events. In any case, large bulk and long hair would be of decided survival value.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=1261

It's eyes glowed red in the dark, and all the sudden it runs straight at me, it was so fast, I mean it traveled about 30 or 40 yards in just a flash and then it stopped right at the edge of the road. I was scared frozen, I couldn't scream or run and we just stood there for what seemed like an eternity but in all actuality was probably just a second or two. Then suddenly it let out a load high pitched growling sound and then I screamed and it turned and ran and I ran all the way home.

He is a 57 year old facilities manager for a large tourist resort near Gulf Shores. He is willing to speak with local journalists about this incident. He needed to go into work that Sunday morning briefly. The sighting happened as he was returning home. He was approximately 100 yards away when he first saw it. He was coming around the bend in the express way when it came into view. There were no other cars in front or behind him. He surmised it waited until there were no vehicles visible in either direction before it crossed the highway, but then he caught it by surprise when he rounded the curve. The figure was already on Rick's side of the express way, roughly in the middle of the road, when it came into view. He cannot say for sure that it was covered with fur, but it was all the same dark color, with no indication of clothes or shoes, etc. He strongly thinks it was not a human for various reasons, including the fact that a person would likely not be running across the express way in that area, and then continue running into the trees where there are no obvious trails, and be completely out of view within a few seconds. Rick has seen deer crossing the express way in recent weeks also. Cotton Creek passes underneath the express way just before the crossing point, so the figure was generally paralleling the path of the creek when it crossed. In Google Maps satellite images of the area you can see a large structure a few hundred yards further up the highway from the crossing spot. That is a brand new structure for ""Toy Box Storage"". It is so new that it does not appear on the aerial images in Google Earth. In fact it is still under construction, so the Google Maps (as opposed to Google Earth) images are very recent.

But, as I get older, I feel this incident needs to be documented.The incident occurred in the winter of 1980 a few miles east of Clayton, Alabama in Barbour County. I was traveling with my Aunt, Grandmother and four younger cousins to a relative’s house. It was dark and probably around 9pm from the best I can remember. For some reason, my Aunt needed to turn around and proceeded to pull off the roadway by a small clearing. I was in the front seat of the car with my Aunt, who was driving, and my Grandmother. As we turned off the road, the headlights caught a figure in mid-stride. It then immediately froze and did not move anymore. It was about 30 yards from the car – very close. I could see the entire side view of this creature and its body was slightly turned so that it was looking at us. The most terrifying thing in my memory is this things huge eyes glaring at us. The best way I can describe the creature’s expression is “stunned.” The face was covered in hair except for around the eyes. The hair was dark and appeared longer and wavy looking on the arms and legs. It was very tall and massive yet lean looking. I would say it was easily over 7 feet tall, if not more. When it “froze” in the headlights, one arm was slightly extended behind the creature and it held this position. At this point, my Grandmother was crying and begging my Aunt to drive away. Two of my younger cousins were huddled on the floorboard in the backseat crying. I was terrified but could not look away. My Aunt kept telling my Grandmother “there is no way he can get in this car” and she kept the car still and we watched this motionless creature for about two to three minutes. It was almost completely motionless. It was as if the creature thought we could not see him if he did not move. I don’t know how it stood so still. The hair on my neck is standing on end as I type this. It scared me terribly. He kept staring at us with his eyes stretched very wide. I’ll never forget that “look” he gave us. Finally, my Aunt decided to flash the lights on and off real quick. The instant she did this, the creature jumped towards the woods and was gone. He was about 10 yards from the woods but made it there in less than a second. I can’t believe how fast this huge creature could move. This event traumatized me. I have never been able to go in the woods alone or enjoy camping since this event. I tried to deer hunt but could not enjoy it and quit – I can’t sit alone in a tree-stand without thinking of this creature and becoming tense. I can’t imagine coming upon this thing alone in the wilderness. I know these creatures exist. There is no doubt in my mind. I saw one up close and personal.

I piped up and told them that in was not a good idea. the trees cause a tunnel affect over the river. the helo wouldn't be able to see under the growth. on top of that the sun was starting to go down. he agreed and sent 6 men in 2 canoes down the river. 30-45 minutes passed and we were told that they had been found at a local bar in b'ham. my friend and I volunteered to pull the rescuers out of the river at a mid point near the road. we set off. the light was almost gone. as we made our way down the trail to a place where the stream and the cahaba meet my friend took off ahead of me. he knew the area better and i could see his light moving ahead of me. as I entered the bottoms where a bamboo thicket grew, I heard brush breaking and grunting noises to my left. I quickley made my way across the stream. I felt much better and safer once I crossed the stream. as I rejoined my friend at the intersection of the stream and river, I told him about what I had heard. he said it was probably a boar rooting for acorns. we sat for about an hour waiting. the moon was out quarter waxing, and hot as hell 100% humidity 90 degrees. after waiting I said to my friend that we must have missed the rescue team in the night. so he went to find out and he left me there on the bank to make sure they were not just slow getting down the river. another 30 minutes went by and I started seeing a light up the bank approaching my position.

This is the time of day the deer should be coming out. As it approached, crossing the last few rays of sunlight, TB could see something too dark to be a deer. Stepping into his shooting corridor was a 6-7 foot tall beast with brown hair and red tint. The creature was of slender build, with heavily defined upper leg and calf muscles. The creature appeared to be female as breasts swung with each stride. The face was covered in hair, small ears and very large eyes; it walked purposely with a relaxed stride swinging the arms. The arms hung down around ¼ the length of the legs. Being high in the tree stand with camouflage and upwind the female didn’t seem to notice TB at all. The being was coming from deep woods with limestone outcroppings. The witness was completely frightened as soon enough time had passed, TB left his stand and an arrow to head out of the woods",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=42939

The woods went right up to the road, there was very little shoulder. Although they did not get a look at its features, the hair color was dark brown and the behavior was definately not that of a bear. They immediately went back to look for tracks and see what it dropped. They could not find any tracks in the hard packed ground. When they found the rabbit, the hair stood up on their arms and they decided that it was time to go. The rabbit did not look like it had been pulled apart, it looked as if it had been neatly cut in half just behind the front legs. During the interview, the witness shared that there was a smell that reminded him of a sweaty, football locker room. The 7' height estimate was determined by the branches that it hit as it jumped into the woods. They had their windows rolled up, with the radio on when the sighting took place, so nothing was heard.

Then I heard the sound of something coming up on the front porch so I sat up to look out the front window, it just so happens that we left the porch light on and what I saw was unforgettable and unbelievable. It was squatting down right in front of me I guess it was too big to stand straight up on the porch.

The witness had been at a family reunion, they had gathered all the trash and food scraps into trash bags on the front porch, (15’ x 15”x 9’). The trash consisted of ribs, chicken, burgers and drink cans, etc. Around 3:30 am on July 5, 2015 the witness was sleeping on the couch, right next to the porch. His cousin ""L"" was sleeping in the bedroom down the hall from the porch. The cousin heard it coming as she had seen and heard it before. Cousin ""L"" stated she just laid quietly in her bed, thinking ""I told him about this thing and he just laughed, so who’s laughing now"". She had heard it approach before and was waiting for the brothers reaction. The dog that yelped was a small dog at the back of the mobile home. Evidently it yelped when cousin ""L"" picked the dog up and put it in bed with her. (The dog being killed that was mentioned was a cousin's dog at a different location, not sure what could have killed it.) The witness stated that all the yipping little house dogs suddenly stopped their barking and went quiet. He then heard and felt the front porch groan. He sat up and cracked the blinds to see what was going on. He saw a Sasquatch come up to the porch, duck under the roof, sit down and start rummaging through the trash bags. They had left the porch light on, a 60 watt bulb, so very good visibility. As he watched this creature digging though the bags, it didn’t even get up to reach other bags. The arms were thought to be 4 - 5 ft. long, the fingers were described like Snicker bars with finger nails, and the head was shaped like the back of Darth Vader’s helmet. The hair was about 4 – 5 inches long, the hair was colored dark brown with a hint of red. The entire back was very muscular, the feet were estimated to be at least 16 inches long, and very broad. After doing some measurements it would appear the Sasquatch was about 8 1/2 feet tall and maybe 800 lbs. It had a very bad smell like cheese gone bad. The Sasquatch never did turn to where the witness could see the face. The witness was too scared to move, he’s not sure how long the creature was there. He is sure it was at least 20 minutes. His cell phone was on a charger across the room. He didn’t want to move and scare it away. When it was done it just took a leap to the ground and strode off though the yard across a 30 foot road in two strides, down a ravine and was gone. During my visit I was shown what appears to be finger and hand prints on the trailer. The fingers start at the far left side of the trailer, with the fingers closed together, and as the Sasquatch walked toward the porch the fingers began to open until at the bedroom window it became a smudge of a hand print. The fingers and hand print were at least twice the size of mine. The hand print was smudged like it had been looking in the widow and was trying for a better grip. Photos of the prints on the trailer:There is a long history of sightings in the area. It’s a sparsely populated area with just a few homes that are usually close together. There were more stories, but those witnesses couldn’t make it the day I was there. Other stories from the family include a cousin being observed as he stood next to his truck on a rural road; a close encounter by two others cousins, after almost hitting one as it entered the road in front of their vehicle; and another incident involving a young family member being chased as she delivered plates of food to her grandparents who lived nearby. Regarding the wish to kill something, I explained that we have never received a report where a Bigfoot hurt anybody. That they all have their own personalities and more likely there isn't just one in the area. I suggested that they may not take lightly to one of theirs getting shot. The folks living there who had close encounters realized at how much they look like humans, and they really couldn't kill any of them. One of the children attempted to take a photo of a Sasquatch from 200 yards, here is the photo, unfortunately it is blurry and little detail is seen: There is no doubt in my mind this was a real encounter. I know the area and if I were a Sasquatch, that's where I would live.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=49238

The farm has about 300 acres of woods covering an area of deep hollows leading down to sloughs off of a river. In late summer and fall of '79 we had been having trouble with deer poachers and some cattle rustling on our farm, so I was spending a lot of time out at night and on my off days trying to catch them. Several times at night and a couple of times during the day I had heard strange screams back in the woods towards the river. The first time I heard them, I thought it might be a peacock or a screech owl, but it really didn't sound like either, and it seemed to be much louder and more prolonged. I really didn't think much of it until one night I was walking back to the house from the back of the farm at about 11:00pm. It was a clear night with a bright half moon shining and I could see quite well. I was skirting along the south edge of the woods about 1/2 mile due north of the house when suddenly I got a creeping feeling that I was being watched and/or was in danger. My skin started crawling and the hair on the back of my neck and hands stood up. At the same time my dog, a large doberman pinscher, started acting nervous and whining quietly and started looking back over his shoulder to our left towards the woodline. I eased the safety off on my rifle and increased my pace. Right at that instant, something screamed right in the edge of the woods less than 35 yards behind and to the left of us. The pitch and volume of the scream was incredible. I could feel my chest vibrating from the loudness of the scream. My dog and I both broke and ran to our right out into the pasture about 50 yards and I spun around and stopped with my rifle up to see if it was chasing us, but it wasn't. I stood there with my rifle up and whatever it was screamed at us five or six more times. Also I could hear movement in the dry leaves where the sound was coming from, that sounded like a large person pacing back and forth. I could also see the tops of some saplings and small trees sway and move as it bumped into them or pushed and pulled on them. The screams were longer lasting and a little lower pitched than what I had heard before. I also know for sure that they weren't bobcat screams. I became aware of the sound of our cattle running away towards the southwest. The woods got quiet but I knew it was standing there still watching me. But I never saw anything. I backed away for about 100yds and then broke into a jog back to the house, spinning around and stopping with my rifle up about every 50 yards or so to make sure it wasn't following me. A few nights later, I was up late about 1:30am and getting ready for bed. I came out of the bathroom into my bedroom and my dog was standing there staring towards the front of the house. He was completely stiff, with the hair standing up on his back and neck and he was growling very low and menacingly. It was the ONLY time I ever saw him do that and he was deadly serious. I got a glimpse of a shadow move across the corner of my front bedroom window moving towards the west side of the house. The moon was shining right on the west wall of the house. My dog turned towards the west and kept growling even more seriously. Then I saw a large, sort of human shaped shadow move across both windows on the west side of the house. The dog kept turning and growling and following the shadow. Whatever it was, had to have been about 10 feet tall to cast a shadow that far up on the windows. I was petrified with fear.

At the time he was 18 years old and was with his cousin deer hunting on some property near his home. A tremendous ice storm had previously passed through the area, and left large tree branches on the ground. They heard a loud “pop” like an aluminum bat being hit on one of the trees or branches. They also heard footsteps, and this caused the men to turn to look behind them. A large creature stepped out from the tree line about 35 yds away. It did not move after noticing them, and just stared with squinting eyes “like someone does with poor vision after taking their glasses off.” It was described as having a large “melon shaped head”, with somewhat long, light brown hair with red highlights. The body was covered with similar hair. No nose or mouth was noticed. It stood on two legs, very long but proportionate for the body which was very massive and upright, standing about 9 feet tall. Musculature was not very noticeable due to the great amount of hair covering its body. Its feet were not noticed, being hidden by ground foliage. It made no further noise or movement toward the men. He distinctly remembers a smell associated with the sighting to be similar to rotten eggs and earthy, as well as smelling like the creature hadn’t bathed ever. He distinctly remembers being extremely frightened. He and his cousin then ran away from the creature as fast as they could. The creature did not follow. After thinking more about the visual sighting, he feels it was probably closer to 30 seconds. This witness was quite relieved to be able to tell his story after so many years. Over the past 11 years, he has talked to numerous other individuals in the area who have also had similar stories to tell like his. This witness also related an event that happened at age 21. He was at this same area camping with his cousin and had just cooked some hamburgers. His pet German Sheppard, who normally is quite aggressive and ferocious, began barking and growling at something in the nearby woods for at least 20 minutes. The dog then ran into the woods about 20 yards, and was then seen flying back out of the woods with a backward somersault, whining tremendously. The dog ran past the men out of the camp, still whining the whole time. They later found the dog back home. The cousin stated he saw something large and brown, but no other description was given.

Witness information withheld. The following is the witness’ account as related to Investigator Tim Cullen: At approximately 1:30 a.m. on a night in February 2000, the witness and a friend were planning to visit a girl who lived close to the sighting location. They were riding together on a motorcycle and knew they would not be able to ride up to the girl’s house without alerting her mother to their presence. They decided to hide the bike on the side of a dirt road and walk to the house from there. Very shortly thereafter, they began to hear what the witness described as very heavy walking/stomping noises. The witness described these sounds as similar to: 1. an extremely large person walking or 2. like a horse galloping only on two legs, coming from a swampy area which was northeast of their location. They squatted in the bushes and listened for a couple of minutes, at which time they determined the noise was getting closer to them and increasing in pace. At this time they decided to make a break for the motorcycle and vacate the area. The friend of the witness was in the lead and caused a branch to swing back hitting the witness in the head, knocking him down and “damn near knocking him out.” He got back up and began running after his friend all the while hearing the sounds of stomping and the crashing of underbrush getting closer to them. When he reached the spot where the motorcycle had been stashed, his friend was already pushing it out towards the road. He commented that at this time he could also hear heavy breathing which seemed to coincide with each footfall. Once they had the bike on the road, they both jumped on and his friend managed to kick start it and take off. The witness stated that he looked back just in time to see a very large creature leap from the edge of the woods out into the road. (I later measured this distance and it was a 12’ to 15’ jump, more or less.) He said it hit the road on all fours and then stood fully erect. He did comment that when the creature landed on the road, it let out an audible grunt he could hear even above the noise of the motorcycle. He said the moon was full or near full, and it was already in the western sky causing the creature to “stand in its own shadow.” Since the creature was silhouetted, he was unable to make out any detail such as facial features. However, he was emphatic that what he saw was not a bear as he’s seen bears before and they are much #8220;narrower” than what he saw (He emphasized this by hunching his arms forward and dropping his shoulders to indicate how a bear would stand and then standing fully erect with his arms out from his sides in the stance that he said he observed the creature to be in.). He said this creature was very wide and had “fluffy” hair which covered it entirely. He was unable to see any fingers on the hands although he did state that from what he could tell the hands appeared to be clenched and that the arms were longer than a human’s. He also said that from what he could see the creature appeared to be a dark brown or black color. When asked about the height of the animal, he said it was at least six to seven feet tall. After thinking for a moment he stated that his father is 6’ 4” and that this thing was bigger than his dad, making it closer to seven feet in height.",1,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,"dark brown , black",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"wide , hands clenched",NA,stalking,when landing from jump it landed on all fours then got up on two legs,bipedal,"grunting , heavy breathing",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,"This witness displayed some involuntary emotive reactions to his own telling, and reliving of his experience that show he is not making anything up.

ALSO NOTICED: ""It looked right at me and kept eye contact but just kept running. I heard it crashing through the trees after it ran by. Before that I had found large footprints near the river and didn't think much of it. Once I saw the creature, I knew it had made the prints I saw a few months earlier. This report was first brought to our attention after BFRO Investigator Vince Lauria gave a lecture at a country club in Alabama. A Birmingham attorney volunteered the information that a caretaker on his land had seen a bigfoot several years ago. The attorney claimed that he had never really believed bigfoot existed until his caretaker had stated that he had seen one. The attorney commented that the man has worked for him for several decades and that he was incredibly honest. “He never lied to me before, so I can’t imagine him lying about something like that.” With the exchange of names and information we were able to contact the witness and hear his story. In August of 2004 the witness was driving north on private land along the Sepulga River. It was dusk, he had been plowing fields. As he turned a bend he saw a 6-7 ft black, hairy creature cross the road from right to left. The witness said it was less than 20 feet in front of him running quickly. It looked at him, kept eye contact but never slowed down or stopped. The witness had his window down and could hear it running through the thick woods after he lost sight of it. The witness described that it had a manlike face, with very long arms. The hair was black and shaggy, and he could see the hair hanging from its hands. It was not thin, but muscular. Dark skin was visible on the face, it had a wide nose, and a conical head. When it ran, it pumped its arms. It came from the direction of the river, and appeared to be wet. The witness said he had found footprints by the river earlier in the summer and didn’t know what had made them. Once he saw the bigfoot, he then realized that it had been responsible for the prints. He has not seen or heard of one before or since that summer. He told his boss and family only. The witness, his family, Investigator Vince Lauria and I went to the location of the road crossing. It is heavily wooded, bordered by the river and farm land. It is very secluded. There is a power line road that borders the property as well. Vince recalls interviewing a Native American brother and sister that saw a bigfoot on the other side of the river less than a mile away.

She never heard approaching footsteps or noise of any kind, indicating something had come into the neighbor's yard, though the creature was only 25 yards away from her when she observed it.

Initially hesitant to speak in great detail for fear of ridicule, she opened up to me and revealed details of this encounter after I assured her of her anonymity. Adding to her credibility is her husband, a retired police officer of 34 years. Though he jokingly told her she saw a bear, he told me when speaking to me by phone, that he knew that his wife had seen a very large creature that day that was not a bear. He said she went into a temporary shock, and by the look on her face, and manner of her speech, knew she was telling the truth.

The friend is a law enforcement officer in a county that adjoins Cullman County. The LEO has seen one of the animals similar to the one described by this witness. He, his father and brother have been aggressively intimidated by similar animals on their hunting land. A few years ago he took an exceptionally good photograph of a large, man-like track left by an enigmatic primate on the property of a family member. I have had the pleasure of working closely with the friend in investigating his and other residents’ reports from that area of Alabama. I spoke with the witness several times after his first call. As a result of those conversations a few more details can be added to his original report. • The first sounds that he heard before the figure came into view were yipping and barking which he thought were made by coyotes. • Those sounds were immediately followed by whooping, a loud yelling sound and loud bipedal footsteps. • He then saw a large, dark hair-covered figure “walking hard” out of a draw to his left. • The figure was walking at an angle past him about seventy yards away when it turned left into thick brush to walk directly up slope toward the top of what is locally called Wilhite Mountain. • The witness stated the animal was in view for about two minutes. • He could hear the sounds of the animal’s travel up the mountain for a minute or so. • The animal was “dark” colored, about eight feet tall, taking long strides while leaning forward and with only moderate movement of its arms. • The animal’s upper body was very wide and thick, with little tapering to the waist line, and the head appeared large. • Facial features were not noted. The witness is believed to be a credible observer and his encounter report valid.

Her accounts were consistent and believable. Here is a sketch made by the witness: The following can be added to this report - The hair was six to eight inches long The hair was dark brown. There were leaves stuck in the hair on the buttocks. The head was very bulky. The huge size of the hands was the most remarkable visual noted by the witness. The right hand held what looked like a rock. The rock was egg shaped and almost as large in diameter as a bowling ball. The creature handled the rock as if it were a softball. The creature’s movement was powerful. The estimated height was 7’ 6”. The estimated weight was 450+ pounds. This sighting was at sunset. The witness hit her brakes and horn when she saw the deer sprint full speed across the road. She had never seen a deer run that fast. As the car was stopping, she saw the creature coming to a stop near the roads edge. The headlights started to light up the creature as it turned to its left and walked back into the pine forest. She slowly drove forward until she was at the point where the creature entered the forest. Her window was down and she could smell a very strong, musty odor with the power of skunk. She could also hear the creature making deep, raspy, loud grunts. When she looked for the source of the grunts she could see the creature about 50 feet inside the wood line facing her car. These grunt unnerved the witness and she drove home. I met with the witness the afternoon after the encounter where the sighting took place. The pine forest was thick with trees from 3” to 12” in diameter. The ground was covered with a thick layer of pine needles so no tracks could be found. I did find deep scuff marks near the roads edge where she said the deer sprinted across the road. We stayed road side for about an hour as it started getting dark. There was a huge storm front moving in and lightning could be seen flashing on the horizon. I decided to make two quick whoops to see if there would be any response. Two seconds later there was a faint response that we both heard. The response was of the same cadence and tone I had used. We stayed there in the dark for about 20 minutes then left because the storms were getting close The witness went back to the site alone 2 days later. She started to smell the same odor again after about 10 minutes. The odor started getting stronger after another 2 minutes so she left and did not go back.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=45296

As military firefighters we would often be assigned to small airfields (stagefields) around Ft Rucker. At the time this happened I was assigned to Tabernacle stagefield. Tabernacle was on the north west end of a large impact area used for aerial gunnery by pilots in training. During a typical duty day we would have several down time periods where aircraft were not flying. These down time periods would typically take place around noon and evening lasting 2.5 to 3 hours. When I was assigned to Ft Rucker, I had met some other Soldiers that introduced me to Indian “relic” hunting. This consisted mostly of lots of walking through tilled fields, creek washouts, and recently cleared timber tracts looking for arrowheads and anything else related to the old Indian tribes that formally lived in the south east Alabama region. I had found that the down times when aircraft were not flying often granted me the chance to get out in the woods to hunt for arrowheads. Often I was able to get several miles away from the stage field during the down times and was usually by myself for several hours. My typical hiking outfit was to put on a pair of cargo shorts, an old pair of army boots, a belt with a canteen, a pouch (for any finds), a large survival knife, ball cap and a walking stick. I usually would not wear a shirt hoping to get a tan while out walking. This day in particular was in I left my stage field around 1100 AM or so. I headed East, North East for about 1.5 miles on an improved asphalt road that bordered the impact area. I then head north down a dirt road (path was more like it) that was seldom traveled. The road went up and down some gentle hills and was bordered on both sides by heavy vegetation and thick woods. I believe I had walked maybe ¾ of a mile when I was approaching a small creek crossing which was not unusual. I was maybe within 50 feet of the creek when off to my left side I heard a lot of movement approximately 150-200 feet into the woods appearing to come from the creek bank. I heard what I can only describe as a grunt and my first though was a wild pig. That thought was quickly erased though, as I immediately got instant chills…goosebumps running my entire body…and had the heavy feeling that I was not alone. I heard another grunt and peered into the woods from where the sound came from and saw a large “shadow”…easily 6 to 7 foot tall stand from the creek bed. Because of the thick woods I got no clear view of it but my first thought was that it was a large very dirty man but it definitely had the appearance of a man shape. I only saw this thing for a few seconds as it appeared to see me…and me watching it and it turned and went crashing into the woods away from me. I wasted no time turning my walk into a trot away from what I had just seen. Whatever it was it scared me and as I headed back to my airfield I tried to make sense of it. The only thing I could conceive it being was that maybe it might have been a stray horse back in the woods. I know this sounds very unlikely but I really didn’t want to believe I might have seen something I could not explain…a horse in the woods I could almost believe. I never went back into that area of the woods again, and seldom ventured into thick woods period after that. I never gave it much thought after that as I had chalked it up as being a horse, which seemed to make sense to me. I did bring my strange experience up a couple of times to some folks but they thought I was kidding them and none of them had ever heard of anything like that in Alabama before. Two things led me to revise my thinking of what I saw that day. The first being this. In 2000…I was and am still living in Kansas and serving in the Army Reserve. We had a new Soldier join my unit. He was a former Ranger Sniper team leader having been assigned to the Ranger battalion at Ft Lewis, WA. He was a good old country boy from Kansas living in a small town. He and I became very good friends and later served in Iraq together. We would often talk about events in our lives at length. During one conversation I related my story about what I saw in the woods assuming he would think I was nuts. But…he believed me. As a matter of fact he said if I saw something I found hard to believe he said that I should just go with what my gut told me. He then informed me about his experiences. He told me about his time up at Ft Lewis and as a sniper he would often be in the woods alone for days at a time in hide sites during training missions. He told me that at night in the deep woods he would often feel as if he was being watched and would hear the sounds of something large moving through the woods. Now this fellow was an experienced woodsman and was used to the sounds and smells of the woods. On occasion he was able to see something quite large in the shape of a man moving around his hide site through his night vision goggle. He said it would never come too close…just kind of checking him out. He said he never felt threatened by it and on the occasion it would make some sounds (grunts or whistles) as if it was agitated and he would talk calmly too it. He said that he wood talk in a slow, low voice telling it “I’m not here to hurt you, just calm down, I don’t mean no trouble for you”. He said that usually after he spoke towards it, it would just move away from him and would leave him alone. He said this happened numerous times as he was often in the same area. He told me he had no doubts at all that “Bigfoot” was around but he would never do anything to harm it and he felt that if left alone it would not harm anyone. So that got me to thinking, maybe that afternoon in the woods I really did see a Bigfoot. The second reason I feel that I didn’t see what I convinced myself was a horse is that after culling the BFRO website I found that I am not the only one to have seen something in Alabama. So…I am not alone and I am now convinced that what I saw was real…and not something else. I haven’t shared this story with very many people…but maybe this is the time to do it",1,6.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,dark,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,moving from river to the woods,NA,bipedal,grunting,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"The witness is a 37 year old male.

The witness also stated that he only saw the creature's right side and back as it turned to leave. The creature did not run, but moved very quickly, with the thick brush offering no resistance. In the written report he stated that he saw a large "" shadow"". During our phone conversation he stated that he did actually see the creature, albeit briefly.

My son, daughter-in-law, wife and I had been over at my in-laws having dinner. My son and his wife and their infant son had recently moved in with us. We were in the process of adding a new laundry room and garage on the back side of our house. When we came in from next door my son and his family were ahead of my wife and me by a minute or two. I noticed the lights to the new addition were on and figured that one of them had gone out to retrieve their laundry. I opened the back door and said is anyone out there. I didn’t yell so I thought they might not have heard me. I stepped out on the patio and started walking toward the garage that didn’t have a door hung yet. As I did I saw a dark figure at the back of our SUV. It scared me that there was “someone” in, or had just passed through our garage. Without saying another word I ran back into the house to get my 410 shotgun and let me son know to join me outside. This only took 30 seconds or less. I went back out but this time I was yelling “if there is someone out there you better speak up or I am going to shoot you.” My son joined me and we ran out into the yard both yelling for the person to identify themselves. We circled our house and saw nothing. It had rained earlier in the afternoon and evening and as we came back to re-enter our house confident that what I had seen ran away we noticed footprints on the concrete patio deck. These footprints at first looked like that of foot gloves people that fit each toe like a glove does the hand. But the thing that was conspicuous was the size. They were enormous. Not only long but wide, huge like that of what an NBA star might leave. (I say that because I have a pair of shoes owned by an NBA star that my nephew gave me who is on an NBA coaching staff.) My point, these were very large feet and very wide strides. It then dawned on me how large the figure I saw in the garage had to be. As stated I own an SUV and at the back part of the garage where I saw the figure the concrete starts to slope down from the garage. This figure I saw was head and shoulders over the top of the SUV and he (it) was already on the slope because he was not inside the garage when I saw him. I joked to my son and later to my family; you know that thing I saw that night was big enough to be a Sasquatch. We all laughed because we had not heard of any other Bigfoot sightings in lower Alabama. Then your show comes to television and I go on your site today and learn that there was indeed a Bigfoot sighting on Ft. Rucker back in the 90’s by a solder. I live just five to six miles from the post. I’m not convinced that what I saw should be reported to you but I do know that if it was a person I never want to see them again on a dark night in my yard because they are a very big person.

The SUV was parked in the garage with the rear of the vehicle at the entrance of the garage. The witness saw the back upper torso, shoulders, and head of the creature. This entire time of observation was five seconds from a distance of approximately twenty five feet. There was no description of arms, lower torso, and legs as they were blocked from view by the vehicle. During this encounter there was a light on in the garage that allowed the witness to notice this detail. However, no face detail was noted, other than the absence of visible ears, because the animal was observed from behind. The witness estimates the height of his SUV at around six foot six inches. The creature in question would have been over a foot taller than the top of the SUV according to witness observation, placing the animal at around eight foot tall. As stated, after about five seconds of observation the witness ran inside. After returning outside with his son the witness noticed three footprints left on his concrete drive due to the animal walking onto the driveway from the wet grass caused by the evening rain. He describes them as looking like a man’s footprint. The witness is fortunate enough to own a shoe once worn by an NBA player. The shoe in question is a size sixteen and the witness states the wet footprint wouldn’t fit into the shoe. He said the width of the print stood out as being wider than the foot that would have been in the size sixteen shoes. He also estimates the distance between the footprints at around four feet with the total distance covered in three steps at just over twelve feet. The area around the witness’ property is wooded with intermittent farms and fields. The animal would have had to cover an area of around seventy-five yards in order to reach the wood line from where the witness observed the creature. According to the witness he was in the house about thirty seconds. I found this witness to be articulate and forthcoming and believe he is credible. In my opinion there is land nearby that would support such animals and there is an abundance of game in the area. The land I reference is Ft. Rucker which is where the Army trains Helicoptor pilots and hunting is off limits on this base",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=34224

I've seen something that can't be explained other than these creatures are not normal creatures. I was spooked and the hair stood up on the back of my neck.

Firstly concerning the trail. He said it was a kind of path that connected a neighborhood with a local grocery store. This trail was bordered by woods all around which could provide plenty of cover for a large bipedal creature to come and go without detection. Also, very near the trail where the encounter occurred is the grocery store dumpster, containing thrown out food. This very well could be the reason this creature was encountered at this location. Now concerning the encounter. The witness said he remembered falling off his bike, looking up and seeing this large, brown hairy creature. He estimated that it was ten feet from him, looking directly at him when it let out a loud howl/growl that terrified him. I asked him about facial and bodily features, other than what he stated in his report. He distinctly remembered the mouth being wide open as it howled/growled, displaying human-like teeth, only larger. The howl/growl was deep yet pitched, and lasted a few seconds. He said it sounded like nothing he has ever heard. Immediately after this it turned and walked off the trail into the woods at a high rate of speed. As it moved through the woods, the witness remembers hearing branches snapping. The witness then got up, climbed on his bike and rode home as fast as he could, where he hid in his house, fearfully peeking out the window hoping the creature did not follow him home. The witness seemed very credible to me. He was clear about the details he remembered and did not try to embellish or add to it. To this day the witness has not returned to the site of the encounter.

They had been going in and out of the house to cut boards by the light of a pole light outside. The son carried one board in and the witness grabbed a second board, as he did he looked out over the backyard. The outside light cast a shadow over the trees in the backyard. As he looked around he noticed a raunchy smell like something dead. Then he noticed that he had one too many trees in the yard. The “tree” took a step and a half crossing the 10 ft. wide path of light. The creature was 8ft tall, about 500lbs, graying hair like you get as you get older with patches of dark brown. The creature was very muscular with knee length arms. The witness, a fifteen-year marine veteran, stated that he had seen a lot of things, but not once did he think of grabbing a gun and going to look for tracks. He knew what he saw. Two nights later his brother who is a pastor saw the same creature cross between his truck and a car in front of him in his headlights. Two nights after that the witness and his 27 year-old son were leaning against the tail gate of the pickup, as they looked across the yard. The son said ""there’s a little one at the edge of the woods"". As they watched the “little one” stood up to be the 8ft adult that was seen four nights before. Shortly after that, a few days later, the nieces came running in screaming, saying something was after them and had been throwing rocks at them. The witness and his brother grabbed two rifles a 30-06 and an AR-15. They stood on the pool deck looking around to see what was going on. The longer they stood the more the cool night air took its toll. The witness started inside only to hear his brother a pastor of many years exclaim s**t. The brother stated that when he moved to go in, the creature also moved from behind the tree it had been watching from. The brother was wide-eyed with disbelief as he was told ""welcome to the club"". Since that first night the witness posted on Facebook for the world to see, not caring what people thought because he KNEW. He received a call from his neighbor. That same night as the witness saw the creature; she couldn’t sleep and had gone out to her deck. While on the deck she observed what was apparently the same creature eating pears from her tree. Since then he has had many people step forward with their own sightings. The witness has had 6in diameter trees torn apart, rocks, dirt and other objects thrown in their direction.

The head was down, and both arms were extended forward searching through the grass with hands as if looking for something. It was not digging. The hair was black, with no highlights.

January 5, 2000, three friends and I decided to camp on one of my friend's land. We had two fourwheelers and a dog with us. It was a rainy day and the ground of surrounding area was significantly wet. We decided to camp anyway. It stopped raining about dusk when my friend and I started to pitch the tent, while the other two went back to there house for some more supplies. Mind you we were only camping about a mile from the road and one and a half miles from the landowner's home. About ten minutes after their departure me and my friend started hearing strange grunts, foul smell, and heavy footsteps. It went on for about ten minutes, with sounds getting closer and at random, as though the ""animal"" was trying to scare us or get us to make a move. It stopped when my friends arrived back and we dismissed as deer, spooked by our presence. We told of the incident to our friends and the landowner's son explained that his dad had been experiencing ""strange"" occurences lately. We went on with our camping and rode four-wheelers for about two hours. When we arrived back at camp, we decided to stay for the rest of the night. About ten minutes after arriving back, the same strange grunts and heavy steps began again. This time they were more aggitated and frequent. The sounds came within at least twenty yards of our camp. The area is heavily wooded so I could not see the animal at this time. The animal was across the creek at the beginning of the sounds and eventually jumped down into the creek, about a seven foot drop, and stayed there making grunts and heavy steps there for about five to ten minutes. Being very frightened and defensive, I picked up about a ten pound rock and threw it in the vicinity of the animal below in the creek. I could not see the animal due to the foliage. It must have hit the animal because it gave a loud shriek and ran up the creek away from us, then jumping back up on the bank, a seven foot jump, and running back behind our campsite. It then proceeded to make very loud grunts and ran around the back of the campsite about twenty yards away in the woods out or our fire's sight. It then stopped and we could hear it breathing heavily. Talking amongst ourselves and shouting at the animal, it then made the most blood-curdling scream I have ever heard. I would describe it as high-pitched and seemed to echo everywhere around us. I have heard bobcats and screech owls and can tell you this was not one. We then proceeded to leave hasitly on our ATVs and went and got the father of my friend. He came back with us and stayed awhile with no occurences. He left and we somehow got ourselves to stay for the night. Nothing happened the rest of the night and we went to sleep. I awoke at 3am to the same grunts and heavy footsteps. This time they were very close. They lasted by my watch til 345am. Not awaking my friends in fear of the animal becoming aggressive, I laid there and listened to this animal. Afterwards, I laid there until sunrise and told my friends of the sounds and occurences of the night. They asked me due to my, as they described, pale face and rattled demeanor. We then went and looked for any evidence of the animal. We found locks of hair in the trees, approx. seven foot high, and numerous large footprints, similar to a humans, but with no arch and a very large great toe. We then proceeded to follow the footprints to where, amonst downed trees and foliage, we found where a large animal had been laying. We found hair there also. We continued to trail the animal's leavings when came across the same sounds of footsteps. They were too scared to go over the hill and see the animal making the noise so they told me to. Reluctantly I did, and saw a large upright creature, approx. seven to eight feet tall, walking with its back to me. It was covered in hair, black to dark brown, and had an awful smell. It turned and alarmed by my presence ran away from me. I then turned and ran away from it towards my friends who I shouted to to run. They got up and ran and we ran back to our campsite and stayed there where I told them what I saw. For a few months after that we heard the same grunts and shrieks down the creek where we camped that night. We frequently rode ATVs down there and an occurence was frequent. Occurences also happened at other places, two to three miles away from the area of occurence. A sighting was also reported at a park about a mile up the road from my house, three miles from the creek. We also found footprints in nearby rock quarry. My brother and I also saw a ""brown"" animal, who we thought to be a man at first, but, trailed him to find that could not have been a man, on hunting land a mile from our house. No occurences have happened in the past three years. But, I also don't ride or camp as much, either",1,7.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,"black , dark brown",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,foul smell,NA,"stomping and grunts from afar near campers , jumped into creek , screamed",stomping,bipedal,"grunt , scream",15.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,"I was able to speak directly with three of the witnesses involved in the incident reported. The witnesses described how they were camping on land belonging to one of the families. They had never experienced anything remotely close to what they experienced that night. While two of the witnesses left the area, two of the four stayed behind and began working on erecting a tent. It was then that they first began hearing strange sounds and began smelling a rancid odor (which persisted through much of the night). Keep in mind that these young men all grew up in the vicinity and were well used to all the sounds of the forest. These sounds were uniquely peculiar in that they sounded almost human-like. The witnesses “heard something like a person” 20 – 30 yards away just after the sun had gone down. What they were hearing was similar to the sounds of ""someone walking around."" It was now “pitch dark.” A campfire was burning and flashlights and ATV lights were in use. The sounds began to evoke images of someone “stomping around or jumping.” The two young men now found themselves getting “spooked.” Whatever it was, it remained just out of sight and across the creek. Then, the two began hearing “deep growls.” The young men's dog, a cocker spaniel, was decidedly uncomfortable with the disquieting visitor. The witnesses remarked that the dog was extremely nervous, whiney and afraid through out the evening. When the other two witnesses arrived back on the scene, the sounds seemingly stopped. A while later, the sounds (“stomping, jumping, and growling”) resumed, this time all four of the young men heard them. The sounds continued for approximately 15 minutes, then the unseen entity sounded as though it jumped into the creek and began approaching the young men. At that time, the witnesses, already scared, now became defensive and began shouting (still thinking – indeed hoping it to be human) at the intruder, ordering it to not come any closer. The primary witness indicated that at that time he picked up a large rock and threw it toward the unknown and unseen harasser. The stone must have hit its target or came very close, because the unidentified tormentor shrieked and hysterically ran around the campsite, the whole time the young men hearing its loud panting and breathing. Once it stopped, the witnesses decided to end the stand off and defiantly began to approach the creature. The animal then produced a scream that “sounded like a woman but much more high-pitched.” The primary witness stated that the scream was so loud that it actually made his “ears hurt.” The witnesses immediately left to retrieve one of their fathers. When the witnesses returned, all activity had ceased. The father witnessed nothing of the sort that the young men had witnessed and casually dismissed the incident. The young men were still not sure of what they had encountered. The father managed to calm the young men down, and they reluctantly decided to stay the rest of the night at the campsite. I asked the witnesses why they would choose to return and stay there after having endured such a harrowing experience. The said they all lived there and knew the woods well, and that the animal could have been anything, and they believed that the game of torment was over. Into the night, the primary witness awoke to more noises, but he chose to try to ignore the sounds. He remained awake until the sun came up. When the other young men awoke the next morning, they combed the area for indications of what had tormented them during the night. The witnesses found large humanlike footprints “15 – 16 inches in length with five toes,” and an area where something large had created a nest with a crude, rudimentary roof of tree branches. Also in the area around the nest, they found dark hairs. Apparently they began to hear noises again, and the primary witness “crept” up a small hill and peered over it, only to see a “large, hairy animal” with its back facing him. The animal was at a distance of 30 – 40 yards. It turned once and looked at the witness and then ran off. The witness described the creature as being “dark brown,” and “around seven feet tall,” with a face that “looked like a gorilla.” At that time, the witness thought to himself, “So this is what a bigfoot looks like.” The father came to the campsite and inspected the area. He listened to the testimony of the primary witness and looked at the tracks. He then told the young men that he believed they had been harassed by a bigfoot",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=7427

We got there just before dark and had been there for several hours when it happened. The place where we were is on a large power transmission line right of way.There is a small stream that crosses the clearing, and a very steep hill on the side where we parked. In fact, so steep that it is difficult to drive a four wheel drive down to the stream. On the other side of the stream there is a low level spot that then becomes another steep hill. I would say that the hills are a good 50 feet higher than the stream. I had parked my truck on the hilltop, and we sat on the tailgate facing the stream. Around 11:00 pm we heard a very loud snorting noise coming from the bottom of the hill, and the sound of brush moving and breaking. I thought that it was a wild hog, because they are plentiful in this area, so I told my wife to get in the truck, because I was afraid it would attack us. She got in the truck while I tried to find my flashlight and my gun. When she slammed the door, I heard a loud, low growl/grunt and it sounded like something large started running up the hill towards us. I was standing in the bed of my truck by now trying to shine my light down the hill, but the batteries were weak and I couldn't see very far.There was a very bright moon out so I turned off my light, and could see a large shadow moving around about halfway up the hill towards us. I was listening to it move around and make the same growl/grunt noise. I could also hear what sounded like breathing noises. I then caught scent of a strange, musky, sour odor and heard more brush breaking and what sounded like stomping noises. I was certain by now that this was not a wild hog, but couldn't figure out what it might be. So I told my wife to start my truck and rev the engine a few times and when she did, I heard what sounded like something crashing through the brush heading down hill and moving fast. We were both a little spooked by now so we left. As I pulled out onto the dirt road off the power line trail, I turned toward the bridge that crosses the small stream (the road roughly parallels the power line) a large number of deer ran at high speed across the road,heading away from the stream. I tried to convince myself that it was just deer that I heard,but couldn't explain the shadow I saw",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,foul smell,NA,NA,rushed up the hill to the truck,NA,"grunt , growl",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,"I visited the area with the couple on Sunday, April 01, 2007. During the scouting of the area, two other details were determined. During the interview, the witness remembered that he could see a shadow moving on the slope below him after his wife got in his truck. There was the sound of brush breaking and being pushed down. The witness returned to the sight 3 days later and found pine saplings had been pulled up including the roots and thrown up slope in the direction of where he had been parked. Due to rains, there were no prints noted. The witness remembered times when the dogs used to run deer would either refuse to get out of the truck or would cease to chase deer and return to the trucks and try to get back in their boxes. He also remembered hunting with two other members who had placed two deer carcasses in a creek to keep cool until later in the day. When they returned to retrieve the deer, one of the carcasses was gone. The water level was too low and slow to have floated the dead deer away. He feels someone or something took the dead deer.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=18033

I will say that I moved to Alabama 6 years ago, met and married my husband and he familiarized me with ""the ways of the wild""...ie sounds, smells, woods, etc. I learned as much about the outdoors as I could and visit them often to this day. The experience I am about to share occured in January 2007. My husband belonged to a hunting club and we spent most of our free time enjoying waterfalls and creeks....looking at stars...sitting and talking, absolutely everything slips away when you go into the wild. We decided not to go to the hunting club this night, but to an old abandoned grave yard. An elderly couple used to go there years ago and keep it clean from debris and weeds but since they died it is grown over. It seems to be such a peaceful place full of history and romance. We had been there often and this particular night my husband was, to say the least, enebriated, and we were just sitting in the car talking...the moon was very bright and the stars were all out. I kept hearing branches breaking, to my left, I was in the driver seat of the car and my husband was in the passenger seat. I thought it was probably a rabbit or another critter of the night...but I started to get a very creepy feeling...as if I was being watched...I felt this for a time before my husband asked me why I was looking to my left constantly. I simply said I feel like I am being watched and shrugged it off. The feeling did get stronger and I continued to look to my left into the surrounding woods to find out exactly what was giving me this eerie feeling. This went on for quite a while...I also noticed a foul odor but could not pin point it's source..I thought it was my husbands usual bout of, well to put it delicately, indigestion...I eventually saw a very tall figure and told my husband that someone was in the woods and he was standing between two tall pine trees...He thought I was crazy and laughed it off...I never stopped looking and saw this figure sway from side to side...from tree to tree..never approached...never made a sound. I looked for about 5 or 10 minutes before I was just too scared to stay there anymore, so we left. A similar experience happened to my husband 5 years ago right after I moved here. It is currently posted on this site. I have been encouraged by Mr. M. Collins to post my experience..throughout this experience my husband never witnessed what I saw. He says he could not see anything out in the dark because of the glare of the dashboard lights (we had the radio on low). I am not sure what exactly I did see...I just know that I have frequented these woods for years and have never felt like that before...I do not intimidate easily and I was extremely ready to leave that night. I have gone back to the graveyard, but not nearly as often as before the incident. I am always on guard there. I know I saw something and I don't believe it was a man.",1,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,dog with cataracts,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,yes,foul smell,NA,"standing in the woods , swaying",NA,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"The witness is a health care professional. While not a long time outdoors person, she has spent the last few years going into her husbands leased hunting preserve with him. She is no longer comfortable going into the woods or into this area even with her husband and myself. Though her husband was in the car, he was in the passenger seat and the angle and the glare on the windshield from the radio dial light prevented him from seeing what she was seeing. The witness is quite sure of what she observed. After marking the trees she indentified with tape, and using her husband as a reference (he is 5'11""), the witness feels sure that the creature that she saw observing them was 7 feet tall or at least a foot taller than her husband. Photos of the area and the trees where she observed the creature have been taken. The distance from where the witness was in her car to the trees she observed the creature is about 15 meters. While the brush looks thick from the road, the underbrush is quite thin and would allow a fairly large animal to move unobstructed within the tree line. The shape was that of a man but much more bulky and taller. The head appeared to set directly on the shoulders. The witness also recalled a smell similar to rotten eggs during the encounter. The only other item she recalled was the presence of what she thought was reflected moonlight from what appeared to be eyes. She compared the color to that of a dog with cataracts in appearance. This area is within about 1000 meters by direct line from an area that her husband had an encounter and within 1000 meters of a power line cut.

It occurred in the spring of 1978 or 79. I cannot seem to recall eactly since it has been many years ago. I'm in my early 30's now but, at the time of the sighting I was 13 or 14. I was on an annual family visit to my Grandparents place in Athens. We had gone out to ""the River"" for a few days. I can't recall what day it was but I do remember that is was in the early afternoon. I was a typical kid then so naturally I was doing kid stuff. I had a Frog gig and I was downat the boathouse pier throwing it into the shallow water trying to randomly hit something in the water. ( I did nail a Crappie but, I did not hurt it bad so I let it go). At the end of the slew was a swampy area. This area started approx. 175 to 250 yards from my Grandparents cabin. It was shallow water and several hardwood trees such as Oak or Dogwood, for example, growing within the swamp. The swamp went back perhaps a few miles. (No one in my family nor myself, except maybe my Grandfather, had ventured too far into that swamp). Along the sloping bank from the cabin to the swamp were 3 other cabins with piers. Across from the cabins is a gentle sloping pasture, next to it are a couple of cabins and boathouses. It seems that every time I was at the boathouse and I looked across the water there were always cows in the pasture. However, that day I just let the Crappy go and I happened to look out toward the swamp. As i did I noticed something emerge from the swamp, next to and below the pasture fence about 50 feet, and wade into the water of the slew. It was dark in color, black I think,( this I know because it was a sunny day), it stood upright. It had waded into the water ""knee"" deep. I did not really pay attention at first thinking it was a Bear. However, I looked again a few seconds later and soon realized it was not a bear. It was tall, approx. 8 or 9 feet, well built, and very hairy. I could not make out any facial features due to the distance, I did not notice a neck and the head was round shaped. The animal proceeded to look both ways, it then bent over at the waist and took its left arm and swung it into the water. I noticed the splash. The animal did this twice. It then stood up and looked straight in my direction. It stood there a few seconds then turned around and walked back into the swamp just like a person would. I stood there and just of shrugged my shoulders and went back to messing around. About 3 or 4 minutes later I looked back toward the swamp again and the creature came back out from the same spot that it had before. It waded ""knee"" deep into the water once again and did the exact same thing over that it had done before, including looking my direction once again. It then turned around and wandered back into the swamp in the same area it had come out of. It did not come back out again, for I stayed at the pier for about another hour and I keep looking that-a-way several times. To this day I am convinced that it was trying to catch fish. I never felt I was in any danger even though it was an odd experience. However, being at that age I did not want to go outside alone after dark for any reason including to use the bathroom. ( The cabin bathroom was in the basement and one had to get to it by going outside). It took me a few years too be comfortable there at night. In regards to that sighting there was something I noticed, there were no cattle to be seen in the pasture at the time of the sighting! The funny side to all this is that I had carried a pair of binoculars down to the pier with me and left them sitting next to me on the upper rail. Not once did it occur to me to pick them up and use them! A side note Two weeks earlier two boys had found large human like footprints in that region somewhere as reported in a local newspaper. About ten years ago my Grandmother sold the place. However, I was in Athens a couple of years ago so I drove out to ""the River"" too see the old place. No one was there so I took the liberty of walking downto the pier and boathouse. Except for a new paint job on the cabin and a refurbished boathouse nothing had changed over the years. The slew and swamp were still the same. I remained for an hour picking up fossils since the water was down, it being late summer. During that brief time I looked toward the swamp periodically remembering, wondering, and well, kind of hoping",1,8.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,black,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,round,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,"round head , no neck",NA,"knee deep in water then bent at waist and used left arm to swing in the water , left into the woods , came back and did the same thing",NA,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=799

By the time we were finished feeding everything it was dark but I had decided to run a cord with a light on it out to the fence and work on it a while longer adding more clips to it . The local high school is about 1 or 1 1/2 miles from our house and they were having a tractor pull that night and I could hear the noise from the tractors .Other than that, it was quiet out . The fence is out close to the barn which has a security light on it . With that light and the light on the cord that I had hanging from one of the tall fence post, the area where I was working was well lit . I had been working for about 2 hours when I heard a noise coming from the woods to my left about 100 or 150 yards away . There is a deer trail that runs through the woods there and the noise I heard sounded like something had caught a deer . I continued putting clips on the fence, not thinking anything else about the noise I had heard and about 25 or 30 minutes later at about 100 yards up from the place I had heard the first noise, I heard something make a loud hollering howling sound . Not wanting to believe what I heard, I told myself that it had to have been the neighbors dog . They have a huge dog that has a hoarse bark . Anyway, I decided it was time for me to go inside . I gathered up my tools and just as I was about to get on the four wheeler, I heard it holler,howl again . This time the sound came from the area where I had heard the first noise, that sounded like the deer had been caught . I didn't take time to turn the four wheeler around . I backed it all the way back to the house, right up to the back door .I jumped off, ran in and locked the door .I was shaking so bad I could barely stand . It was like I was having a nightmare, I couldn't believe what I had heard . I told my husband and we went back out with the gun but we didn't hear anything . I knew what I had heard sounded like the sound the bigfoot made on the programs I had watched on TV and at first I even thought I was crazy for even thinking that that's what it could have been and Iv'e tried my best to convince myself there's no way it could have been a bigfoot but it hasn't worked . My husband keeps saying that he believes I had heard something and that there's a good explanation for it because there's no such thing as a bigfoot . He hasn't been able to give me a good one yet . I have called the local game warden and tried to mimic the sound I had heard asking him if he knew of any animal in this area that would make this sound and he said no . He did say that the only thing he could think of might be some sort of canine - a coyote or if it was more of a high pitched sound it might be a fox . Please believe me this was no coyote, no fox, no small animal could make a sound like the one I heard . It was 100 or 150 yards away and it sounded like it was standing right behind me . I could tell that it was coming from something very large because of the power behind the sound and the sound it's self was like a loud Ahoooooooo .There's no way anyone could have been in the woods faking this . It was real . This experience has affected me big time . My doors are closed and locked now day and night - I don't think a locked door would stop it, but I lock them anyway . If I'm at home alone during the day and I need to go outside for anything, I carry a gun with me . Under no circumstances do I go outside at night now . I'm afraid to sleep at night . I'm scared to death here now . I don't know for a fact that what I heard was a big foot but I believe with everything inside me that it was . When I found this sight on the internet and listened to the sounds that had been recorded, I swear to you, I started shaking all over again . It sounded exactly like what I had heard- Exactly- except what I heard was very close to me. This is the bad part of it all - When I called the game warden to tell him what I had heard and ask if there was any animal here that could make this sound, he said some sort of canine maybe . I said ""No Sure, it wasn't any kind of dog or coyote or fox or crane - ( which is what my husband said it could have been-but no it was no crane . I've heard cranes before and they do make a scary sound, but it wasn't a crane.) or any kind of cat , I've never heard anything make a sound like I had heard in real life before. ) He then ask "" what did it sound like?"" I hesitated for a second or two before I said "" A Bigfoot "" He said back to me ""well, like said it could be some sort of canine or something like that."" When he said that, I started crying - I couldn't help myself, I cried and told him that this was no joke that I was serious and that I was scared to death now . I believe he was thinking he had real nut case on the phone crying, telling him how scared she was cause she heard a BIGFOOT in the woods behind her house. I think he got a good laugh out of it anyway . Please believe me every word I've put down on this page is true . There is something in the woods behind my house that hollers, howls and I'm very scared of what it could be . I didn't see what it was and I pray to God that I never do, I did hear it and I also pray to God that I won't hear it again . But with God as my witness this is true . One more thing I would like to say that I have wondered about. I mentioned the tractor pull and I've wondered if maybe the sounds the tractors were making when they would start to pull -the winding up sound of the motors could have been the reason this thing was hollering-maybe it thought there was another one around calling to it but in fact it was the tractors, I don't know. I've thought about what everyone around where I live would be saying about me if they found out that I said I had heard bigfoot in the woods behind my house. If no evidence could be found to show that what I was saying was true, I would have big looney toon wrote across my back as long as I live here, I would be laughed at by everybody. Iv'e decided that I and only I know what I heard and I know how it's affected me -I feel like I've had a close encounter with evil - something I had heard might exist but I didn't really ever want find out if they did, especially from personal experience . I know that I and only I will have to deal with this feeling and that I don't really care what people here say as long as I know I'm telling the truth . If somehow someone did this as a hoax, (no way) they did a great job. I'd have to say that they're professionals. No way is this a hoax on my part. I've never been more serious about anything before as I am about this. Because I am so afraid here now, especially at night, I called the game warden back today and asked if could investigate this just to see if there might be evidence that this thing might have been or might still be in the woods here. He said that they hadn't had anyone else report anything like this but he would check it out. I don't know if he will or not. The answer to my prayers would be for him to investigate it, find it, catch it, and take as far away from my house as he could go. Now that I've wrote all this down and hopefully been able to convince you that this is not o hoax- I only hope that your sight is no hoax!",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,howling,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,sounded as if a deer had been caught,1,NA,NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=15597

As I got about 2/3rds. up the hill I had the hair on my neck stand up and a feeling like I was being watched. This was around 5:00pm. I just casually kept walking till I got home always checking my back. It happened again within a week. Maybe a few days. Did not smell anything cause I had been fishing or no smell anyway. Wasn't long afterwards I was checking on the clouds of a thunderstorm when lightning struck close to the trailer. By this I mean I had my head out the door. I heard a yell about 70yds. behind the trailer. It didn't sound like a cow but I checked anyway. No cows had been in the area for at least 6 months. The scream was high pitched without coming down a lot at the end. With my wife being there, I just closed the door and didn't say nothing. I would say the following Sunday afternoon, my wife went to church at 6:00pm. and I stayed home to watch TV. About 45 min. later, I was laying on the couch watching TV, when something had blacked out my window at the far end of my trailer. The window was 1ft. wide and 3ft. tall. I had raised up to look out my picture window above the couch and it turned the corner and walked around the steps at the back door. It was looking off into the woods and as it kept walking, it looked at the ground. Understand this though, I had clear plastic on my window to keep heat in from winter.(Hadn't taken it down yet.) When it got to the window, I had already laid back down on the couch, looking up and lay still. It looked down at me and kept walking, hopefully. I laid there for about as long as I could stand maybe a minute. Then I got off the couch by sliding on the floor, went and got my gun walked back in the living room and waited a minute, then went outside making all noise I could. I checked the back of the trailer, nothing there. Details of Bigfoot is as follows, he was about 7ft. tall maybe 7ft.3"". Solid black, no white or brown that I could see. Remember the plastic. His head was more rounded and not cone shaped. I could not see the color of his eyes or anything like that. He was broad shouldered and thinner around the waist than what you usually see in the pictures and he walked more upright, not humped over like a gorilla. His hands hung around his thighs. The next morning around 10:00am., I got up from bed as I worked 2rd. shift then. My wife told me a friend of mine had come down to see me. I asked what did he want. She said she only saw him as the top of his head went across the kitchen window. We had to set the trailer on 4 blocks high and 3 on the other end, which meant you could not see anyone walking in front of the trailer, not out the kitchen window anyway. I told her my friend was 6'4"" and with a hat on you could not see him the way she had told me. We lived on rocky ground but I had one dusty dirt spot at the end of the trailer. Hoping he had walked in it. I checked and in the middle was a footprint. It was about 12 and a half inches long and 3 and half to 4 inches wide at the heel. Being dust it was only 1/4"" deep. There were only 3 toes which I did not understand at the time. I told some friends at work and one came to see it. The following Friday or Saturday night, he and a friend of his came over, no drinking sorry. And I told them the whole story. My friend was not hard to convince but his friend started talking big. So I told them let's go outside. Joking around to see how brave he was when we heard two dogs about medium to small size started barking and chasing something on the other ridge behind my trailer. Which was not far at all, maybe 200yds. They chased it into the small valley about 50yds. south of us. When one dog quit barking, the other gave one more then it was quiet. Stunned, we looked at each other and Bigfoot started running back towards us. It stopped about 80yds. from us and started to hit a tree with something that sounded like a branch about 4 to 5 inches thick. Then it ran closer to about 40yds. and done the same thing again. By this time all bravery was gone. I went back in the trailer and got my gun. Come back out and asked if anything had happened. The brave guy thought he might had seen something in the shadows south of us, light was on of course. They took the gun away from me and I didn't mind, thinking I had a way of escape. But we heard nothing else. My nearest neighbor is about 250 yds. away.( Mother-in-law) No one else for at least a mile. No reason to mess with us that I could even think of.

(name removed by investigator) would allow you to dig up the corps to see if its head is missing, you may get some clues or even some hair form the sasquatch. however if the head is still attached, then i was hallucinating the whole thing, and my wife would just imagined the water ripples too. i don’t do drugs, or smoke dope, and didn't at that time either. the only thing running thru my veins is good wholesome native american blood. i would love to participate in pursuing this investigation if there will be one.",1,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,dark,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,long hair,NA,"carrying dog head in left hand by the hair , road crossing",road crossing,bipedal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,powerline cut nearby,1,"I spoke with the witness who recounted his experience as described in the report. The witness saw the animal from about 150 feet as it was walking into the lake. His view was from the animal’s left side. The witness described it as having long hair and described the hair color as being “dark” as he couldn’t discern the animal’s hair color. The witness estimated the creature’s height as being about 7 to 8 feet tall. The witness could clearly see the St. Bernard’s head being carried in the creature’s left hand. The St. Bernard’s head was being carried by the hair on top of its head, snout forward, and flesh could be seen hanging from the dog’s neck. The witness later spoke with the owner of the St. Bernard to inquire about why the dog hadn’t been seen in awhile. The owner of the dog said that the dog had died a couple of days previous and had been buried back in the woods behind his property. It is hypothesized that the buried St. Bernard was located by the creature, dug up, and head removed. The witness has suggested digging up the remains of the St. Bernard in order to confirm what he thinks he saw that night. Current forensic studies suggest that after 15 years, there would be very little left of the St. Bernard due to the natural process of decay as well as the scavenging of animals. The witness, who is very credible, has presented a case that offers the possibility of what appears to be very interesting sasquatch behavior. Editor's note (MM): This location is near a power line route. Sightings and related incidents often occur within a short distance of power line routes. This is true in both eastern and western states. Deer and elk often move and feed under power line routes. The trees and tall brush are cut away in these swaths, allowing berry bushes and grasses to flourish there. There is almost always a gravelled access road under power lines, but very little vehicle traffic throughout the year.",yes,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=18043

The car was about 30 ft from the bottom of the ramp on the back porch and 20 ft from the north end of the car port (which is mostly open, except for a single partially closed in section on the north end). The night was dead silent with no wind. Upon reaching the bottom of the ramp I began to turn to my right towards the car when I heard what can only be described as similar to a bull snorting mixed with a grunt. I immediately turned towards the location of the sound, the back of the carport, and drew my sidearm. Due to a light on in the carport being pointed directly at me, I could not see what it was, but a shape. I had a small flashlight on me and pointed it at the thing. It didn't help much due to the light being in my eyes, but I was able to make out a creature bigger than me and at least 3 ft across at the shoulder. It made the sound again, but didn't move. I called out to it, thinking it was a person, but no response. After what felt like a few minutes, it made the sound again and seemed to get shorter. I began to move to my right towards the car to retrieve a rifle I kept in there and the thing moved to my left, so that we effectively circled each other until it reached the end of the carport on the south end. I reached the car and without turning, retrieved my rifle. As i pulled it out, the creature turned towards the woodline at the back of the property and seemed to either slowly run or quickly walk into the brush. i took this time to go back into the house and get a better flashlight. I came back out maybe 5 minutes later after finding one, to find nothing. The guard dog had reappeared and you could hear various insects around. The next morning I went to the area at the back of the property where the sighting had happened.

With a flashlight he went toward the car, that is when he heard a snorting grunt from the back of the carport. He then saw a shape back lit by the pole light. The figure was about 8ft 6 inches tall (compared to a broken branch found the next day) 3- 4 feet wide and about 500- 600 lbs. The man then drew his side arm and called out. The animal made the same sound again. He thought it might even be a person. Again the sound was repeated, alarmed the man without losing eye contact made his way to the car trunk, where he removed his rifle. It was stated that he never felt threatened. Upon the man gaining his rifle the creature backed off and retreated into the woods. The man then went into the house to retrieve a better light, upon returning with the wife and mother-in-law in tow there was nothing. The next day there were scuff marks on the ground and a broken branch where the creature was seen. The man was told of others that had seen the same thing over the years.

I looked up at my husband and gestured toward the area. Upon looking back, the creature was gone. My husbands nephew was also sitting next to me, and he saw the same thing I saw.

His house is in a small middle class neighborhood with mountains and woods that stretch for miles behind his home. I woke up to use the bathroom at about 4:00AM and had just laid back down when I began to hear loud vocalizations. The sounds where very similar to the Ohio and Mississippi recordings. I was inside the house and his heating unit was running so they must have been very loud outside. I got up and went out on his back deck but by the time I got there they had stopped. I listened for about 10 minutes and heard nothing. The heating unit was next to the deck and was quite loud so I decided to go back inside. About the time I started to fall asleep it started again the howls lasted about 3 minutes. Then stopped I thought that it might be my friend snoring in the back bedroom but I don't believe this was so because the neighborhood dogs where barking throughout the area in response to the howls. At this point I knew something outside was making the noise. I wanted to go into the woods for a better listen, but walking into the woods with no one in the know and not prepared for self defense or to photograph or record the creature did not seem like a wise proposition.

It just ran through the brush. After that I turned around and started paddling back to my truck. I went back down there that night to see if I could spot light it.

Upon standing up the creature and witness made eye contact for around 30 seconds. It appeared to be about 7ft tall and weighed around 400 + pounds. It had a shoulder width of about 3 1/2 ft. wide. The hair was a mix of black and gray along the lines of a raccoon. The hair length was approximately 4-5 inches in length; it was matted with mud up to the knees. It had an odor of fish and mildew. The head was conical, with an almost flat nose. The right hand that was wrapping around the tree as the creature was playing peek-a-boo was black.

Road 17,Lookout Mountain,NA,NA,NA,2345,NA,NA,NA,NA,"hill, forest",pine trees,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I had noted on my Limestone, Alabama Spring 1978 sighting report that I would eventually submit other sightings that involved myself, others I know or did know or had learned from talking with others. I did not know it would be this long to submit them, but I have since married, had a child, lived in three different locations, had five different jobs among other things since I last submitted that Limestone, Alabama sighting. This sighting/encounter below involved myself, and two freinds, it unexpectdly and without intent being my second. The event I relate here happened to me and two friends in April of 1994 while I was attending Troy State University, Troy. I was undertaking graduate studies at the time. I lived in a campus dorm and had become friends with several people in the dorm and about campus. One of these friends stayed in a room a few doors down. He dated a young woman that stayed in the International House across campus. I had been studying on that paticular night I write of and had become bored with it. My friend knocked on the door and came in. I for the most part had an ""open door policy"". The door may be open, but knock before you enter so I'll know you are there. As Kevin and I talked we agreed to go pick up his girlfriend, Donna and go to ""Lookout Mountain"". I had been out to the place once before during the day about a month earlier so I offered to drive. We left campus around 11 pm or so. We headed up Hyw. 231 north. About 8 miles from the Campus we turned west/northwest (left) onto Co. Rd. 17 As we got closer to the so-called Lookout Mountian we noticed fewer and fewer houses. After about 15 minutes of driving we had found it and proceeded to park just off the road. We got out of my vehicle and then walked up to the top of this large hill. The hill is about 100 feet high from what I remember. It is supposedly the highest point in Pike County. The place seemed to be a well known and well used spot with open areas about the path to the top, besides one could see for several miles to the west, south and east from atop this hill. I recall seeing the rotating beacon that night at the Troy Airport several miles to the south. I knew we were not the first people to walk to the top and hang out nor were we going to be the last. Everything seemed cool. After about 15 to 20 minutes we three decided to head downhill toward the car and find something else to get into. I think we had decided we were going to go to Subway for a late night snack. Now here is where it got weird. Just after we started downhill I began getting a funny feeling and the hairs started to rise on the back of my neck, like something was there and we were being watched. Seeing how we were out at night in the country plus having a lady with us, Kevin and I had decided not to be foolish. We had both brought along weapons. I had a Colt .38 stuffed in the back of my pants in its holster and a few extra rounds in my pocket plus a good sharp replica Samurai sword. (Yes, a sword). My friend had a Glock 9mm and an extra magazine of rounds. My friend was in the National Guard at the time. I pulled out the .38 before we got even midway downhill. I had looked over to where Kevin and Donna were to my right. He had already taken out his 9mm so I knew he also sensed something by then as well. It was also about this time that we started hearing rather heavy footsteps. As we moved along I notcied the steps were on both sides of us. By the time we had arrived midway downhill we were aware that there were five maybe six...somebodys or somethings out not far from us. I recall that there were two and I'm pretty sure a third distinct grouping of footfalls to my left and two off to my right. Kevin was closest to the ones on my right so I'm sure he had heard them much better. Also by this time our Donna had become almost hysterical. I'm sure her few screams did not help matters much. Kevin said that it might be some other people messing with us like Frat boys. We stopped breifly. He shouted a few warnings that whomever was there had better leave us alone or speak up, he was ready to open fire. No answers. Nothing. I remained quiet, listening. Now any person in their right mind (perhaps even in a drunken state of mind) would have said something in order to keep from being shot at, I would think, yet there were no answers, no response of any sort. Just slience. We then continued to move downhill toward my vehicle but whatever they were kept back a bit and out of our sight and also to our sides yet they kept moving down along with us, not trying to hide their footfalls. As we approached the bottom of the hill we ran for it, got into the my car as fast as we could, cranked it up quickly, backed up, and took off back the way we had came. I am not sure if whatever they were moved out into the dirt road behind us or not as we drove off. I looked back but, it was really too dark to tell. Aside from that the road was narrow and had trees along each side of it and I was being as careful as I possibly could so as not to run off this road. I don't recommend under such cirmstances trying to drive out of such a place and look back at the same time. It took several minutes after we got back onto Hwy. 231 for Donna to calm down. I was shaken up but not too bad. I suppose the driving had something to do with it. I'm not sure how Kevin felt. I assume that his military training had taken over for a time back on that hill. We never saw what they were. Except for the footsteps they were otherwise quiet. At first I was not sure what they may have been however after considering the strange activites I felt they could very well have been bigfoots. I still feel that is what they were though I can never be 100% sure. Even so, what they did while we were on Lookout Mountain would seem much like reported and researched bigfoot behavior. After a few months and leaving Grad school I eventually lost contact with those two friends. I've not been back to Lookout Mountain since even though I have traveled up and down that part of 231 near there many times. I'm sure with a little driving about those dirt roads off Co.

My girlfriend's father was sitting on the hood of the car with his fishing pole in front of him. He was night cat-fishing. While we sat there, with the car lights shining across the river, my girlfriend and I were sitting in the front seat just making small-talk (honest), when all of a sudden I heard the most horribly incredible scream coming from my right side. To set the scene: Our car was parked about two feet from the water, on the bank. Off to my right about 60 feet was where the foliage began. Very swampy, very thick, and very hard to walk through. About 40 feet further up the bank (which can't be seen from our car because of the foliage) is a huge oak tree. I'd have to guess that the tree had about a 15 foot circumference - massive! About 10 feet up the tree is a huge branch that went about 20 feet out over the river. My friends and I would climb the tree and jump/dive into the river at least once every couple of weeks or so. During one occasion, there were about 9 of us standing on this branch attempting to make it move - we barely made it do anything, let alone shake! Anyway, back to the car. As I heard the scream, my body instantly went into what I think was shock. As I turned to my right s.l.o.w.l.y.. with all my hair standing straight-up, we heard the next sound~~~> a chuuu..chuuu..chuuu..chuuuuuuu... (my feeble attempt to describe the sound of that huge branch I mentioned earlier that was shaking due to something GIGANTIC jumping off it into the water. The splash that came next was equally as horrific. All we did was just sit there in shock...waiting (I don't know why), staring at this point - straight ahead at the water. My guess is that we were waiting for the thing to float into our headlights. We waited and waited and waited and all of a sudden an object - black - long - I would guess at least 9-10 feet, floated into our headlights and stopped. Please keep in mind that this action was deliberate, because it was floating downstream. We stared at it forever it seemed.until it opened it's eyes - two huge balls of red (reflecting off the headlights of our car I imagine) light and looked at us.

At that time, I believed I saw a crazy old man, but I now realize that is all I could rationalize it to be. I was walking alone at dusk with my dog. This was not unusual as I loved to be outside- my parents often had to force me inside by calling me in for the night. Well, from what I can remember of that particular night, I was picking up rocks in a ditch and looking at them. I might have been looking for a certain kind of rock but I can't remember exactly what I was doing. It was definitely getting dark, but I could still see well enough to keep after the rocks for awhile longer. I remember holding a stick I was using to pry rocks out of the dirt. It was very quiet and still and there wasn't much wind. As I was looking at the ground, I heard a noise in front of me and I looked up to see what it was, and that is when I saw him. He stood right in front of me at a distance of 5 to 10 feet, he was tall, but hunched and quietly staring right at me. He wasn't much taller than a normal man, but I got the impression he was old because he was hunching. He looked like Rip Van Winkle to me, and that is what I thought of when I saw him. He had a long shaggy beard around his facial area, but he was completely naked but for the long shaggy hair that was in matts all over his body. I remember the hair was thin at his face, the base of his neck, and upper torso, but thicker around his beard, lower torso and legs. All the hair was grayish white and very long and shaggy. Mats of hair dangled from him in tatters. His feet were bare. His face was very humanlike, but not quite normal as it had very exaggerated wrinkles- again, a reason I thought he was a crazy old man. His head seemed normal, but there was so much hair it was hard to make out his features except where the hair was thinner. He appeared gaunt and thin, but in just a moment I would realize he was not like an old man at all. I screamed as loud as I could out of fear and I noticed my dog bolted towards the house while I was taking in the sight of this strange thing in front of me. The shaggy old man let out a scream of his own when I screamed. He was staring right at me screaming in a voice that sounded like a woman shrieking- he seemed very scared of me as well. I turned to run for my house. I looked over my shoulder to see if he was following me and I saw him run up the ditch in the other direction. He was extremely agile and fast- he was definitely not Rip Van Winkle. He ran in a full sprint, very quickly for someone so hunched. I think I caught the dog running back to the house, as I was so frightened. I remember running into the kitchen and telling my Mom there was a crazy old Rip Van Winkle in the field. I remember describing how he was old looking, hunched, naked, and his hair was very long and matted like he hadn't cut it in 20 years. I told her about how he had hair all over his body. Needless to say, I wasn't believed. I became obsessed with what I called ""the Shaggy old man"" or ""the Crazy old man"". I believed that he must have been an old deformed hermit. I kept a notebook in which I drew many sketches of him. I remember keeping the notebook secret from my family, hiding it out of fear of being ridiculed. I wish I had those sketches now but sadly I've misplaced that notebook. I remember I went back to the spot in the field looking for him on other occasions, but I never ran into him again. I wasn't aware enough to look for prints or anything like that, but I knew that he was out there somewhere and I wanted to prove he really existed to others. What changed my opinion of this sighting was a late night visit to a bigfoot website. I was just browsing their sightings index and I came across several sightings in the same county I lived in and all described white or grayish colored creatures. Honestly, I didn't realize bigfoot were sighted in this part of the country at that time, or even for most of my life, and just seeing all those other sightings was a revelation. I realized for the first time that what I witnessed may not have been a crazy old shaggy man, but rather a bigfoot. When I think back on the sighting, it all makes sense in that light. There would be no reason for a naked old man to wander that field, much less to be covered in grayish, white, shaggy tattered hair. The only reason I never thought of it as a bigfoot before was that I had never heard of an Alabama bigfoot, so the thought never entered my mind. Also, I had never heard of a whitish gray colored bigfoot, and this creature was thinner than a typical bigfoot description- maybe he was older or maybe even younger. He looked a bit hungry to me, as he was not some hulking powerful creature, but he was still strong looking and extremely agile.",1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,grey white,6,grey,NA,NA,NA,yes,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,thin,stooped,NA,"exagerated wrinkles on face , matted hair , resembles ""Rip Van Winkle"" , hair culminated into beard",M,"staring at witness , retreated from witness after screaming",hunched posture,bipedal,high pitch scream after witness screamed at it,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"During a phone conversation with this observant, articulate witness, a few more details surfaced.

The head looked small in proportion to the body compared to a human and was slightly pointed at the very top from the rear view. It was lean and had a very muscular, athletic build. It was not as bulky as the subject in the Patterson-Gimlin film. The calf muscles, with white skin, were huge and could be seen when the 3-4” long black hair would flop up as it ran. The hair appeared to be clean. The witness could hear it running, but it was not very loud. The sighting was in an area with pines and a few large hardwoods. The creature ran to an area with pines and underbrush, which is where the witness lost sight. The area beyond the pines was swampy.

It was a thursday about mid july of last year (1999). We had gotten on the water about 6:30 and started fishing. We put in at Rocky Branch and went up river towards the upper end lock. Towards night fall we started fishing back toward the launch. about 11:30 we were fishing a secluded part of the shoreline. The nearest house was probably 2-3 miles down river. We were fishing close to the bank when I heard something walking at the top of the hill. I figured it was a deer and didn't pay it any more attention. As we proceeded down the bank the sound started down the hill towards us. There were two distinct foot steps instead of four like a deer. I thought I was hearing things so I looked back at my buddy and he was looking up the hill towards the sound. We decided to go look for another fishing spot (because we were getting a little spooked)and started putting everthing up to make our run. As we were doing that, whatever it was broke into a run towards us. Before we could get the boat cranked the creature let out the most herendous snarl and growl I had ever heardand then hit the water after us. We both love to hunt and spend alot of time outdoors but neither of us had ever heard anything like that, nor could we duplicate it when we would tell people of our encounter. I hadn't thought anything else about it until we got on this web site and heard the recording of the growl sound. That was the closest thing I have heard to the sound we heard that night. I'v read that usually there is a strong musty smell preceeding most encounters, but we didnt smell anything unusual. Perhaps this was due to the fact that we were in a cross wind with the creature. We don't know exactly what it was because we havent gotten up the nerve to go back and look around. That was probably the last time I have been on the lake. Everyone we told about this said we were crazy and were hearing things, but none of them will go back with me at night to look for it.

As I proceeded to get closer I turned on my brights. I realized this thing was standing on two feet, and kinda hairy, but looked as if it were humanlike.

It was enormous. I had never really seen anything like that before. I had wondered if my mind was playing tricks on me because I was tired.

He walked over to it and stated that he wondered what might have made such a large pile. As he looked around for horse or cow tracks, another person walked over to look at it and said ""Look at the size of these foot prints"". They all began looking around and found tracks coming out of a grassy area onto a dirt road. The tracks went about 20 feet then turned left into the freshly plowed field (plowed the day before). They proceded about 30 feet into the field. There you could tell where it paused to squat repositioning it's feet to do so and did it's business. While in this position it dug up some turtle eggs in front of it and ate them leaving broken shell behind. The feces were the consistancy of horse droppings in that they were of high fiber content and contained undigested muscadines(a kind of wild grape). But the droppings weren't in the shape of horse manure,(round ballshaped piles) but were long and cylindrical like that of a dog or human. The feces(2) were about 18-24 inches long and about 2 1/2-3 inches across. Rather large I must say. The tracks then turned left again into an area of tall grass, small pines and other small trees that lined a field at the edge of the woods. I wasn't able to follow them very far due to dead branchs, briars and undergrowth that blocked my progress. Plus I was wearing only sandals, shorts, and a tank top. Not prepared to trek through the woods. I took pictures of the tracks and the feces with a yardstick for size comparison. I also took a specimen of the feces and turtle egg shells which are still in my freezer. I have a cast of a left and right foot. The right one broke trying to pick it up but is still n pretty good shape. The left one is completely intact. They measure approx 18 inches long, 8 inches wide at the toes and 4 1/2 inches at the heels. The stride measured 3 feet from the toe of one foot to the heel of the next step. Each foot has 5 toes. A humanlike large toe on the inside of the step and each toe following being smaller than the last. There is an arch to both, showing it is not flatfooted. I took these samples to the Univesity of Alabama and showed them to a professor who is an anthropology professor in forensics. I walked away disappointed to hear him insist that what I had were Bear tracks. But he had been on a bear trip since I had spoken to him a few days prior about my find. When I arrived at his office, before he even looked at the cast he was talking bears and showing me books and pictures of bears and bear tracks. I tried to say Bears don't have a Big toe, but he tried to make up reasons that these tracks of a ""bear"" had a big toe. I realized this person was not going to believe what he was looking at was not a bear. It either frightened him to think it was a possible Bigfoot out there or he was embarassed to say he didn't know what it was. Just a ""Bear"". Well there is our encounter of a Track sighting.

They showed me the place where the tracks were found, but it had since rained and the tracks were no longer present. They also showed me a shooting house (for deer hunting) which had been broken and overturned. They then showed me the photos and casts of the tracks, which were just as described in this report. I examined the casts carefully, looking for any sign that they could have been faked. I found no such indication. The size and shape of the tracks plus the step interval definitely DO NOT indicate bear. The witnesses first thought was that someone must be playing a practical joke on them, but the fecal evidence and the tracks just seemed too definitive to dismiss or explain away as a joke, especially considering the fifty-four inch step interval they measured. Photographs of the tracks and casts were also sent to experts within the BFRO for analysis. The witnesses did not insist that there was a real Sasquatch present at the property; they simply wanted help in determining whether the evidence was hoaxed or is genuine. I saw no indications that point in the direction of hoaxed evidence. Evidence collected by the witness was sent by the BFRO for scientific analysis, but the analysis proved inconclusive and does not contribute to our understanding of this event at this time.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=6938

It came from behind my house and it yells out in that long guttural yell three times and after the third time it sounded like there was 50 or more coyotes were surrounding us and they stated yapping like crazy. ... The recent sounds are coming between my Grandfather's old house place and my home... It is about a 1/2 mile away. We have a huge lake behind us and nothing but woods... My grandfather has some old abandoned gravel pits and lakes close by too.. There is a swamp in front of our home about 1/4 mile away. I was also told when I was a child that back in the 1930’s my grandfather went through the gravel pit one night ... He saw something setting on a hill that looked like a huge hairy thing that had a face like a man.... This was before all the media hype from the Patterson films.. I need help because this thing is getting closer to our home. My husband doesn't have good hearing and he said he could hear it upstairs one night and it sounded like it was in the yard.

I found their accounts to be consistent and believable. There were two sightings and the following can be added to the report: The first sighting was in 2011 at noon with the mom and son both witnessing the creature from their car. This route is driven by both witnesses daily. The hair was dark brown, long, shaggy and matted. The legs and hips were extremely thick and full of muscles. The height was estimated at seven feet and weight at 350 pounds with no fat noted. It crossed the road and into the woods in about three seconds. It moved very fast, running left to right on two legs. It used its hands and arms to shield its face as it sprinted into the thick undergrowth and branches. They were driving at 30 MPH when she hit the brakes. The biped was about 15 feet from the bumper by the time she stopped. The second sighting was in April of 2014 at 9 pm and happened within a few feet of the first sighting. The son was alone and driving home during the second sighting. The creature was dark in color and about the same size as the one seen in 2011 with a thick back noted. The creature dropped down low and ran away into the woods on the left side of the road when the high beams hit it. The two witnesses went to the location of the two sightings the following day, found and photographed some possible formations made from small, twisted branches and broken branches on the ground. We have reviewed the photos, not enough detail is seen to determine whether or not they were made with hands or if the branches broke and the sticks fell that way naturally. In August of 2014 at 2 am, the son's friend drove up to his house and a biped could be seen walking inside a wood line behind the house. It stepped behind a tree when the high beams were turned on. Eye-shine was then seen peeking out to the left then right side of the tree, back and forth for about 20 minutes before the eye-shine disappeared.

The area used to be heavily mined years ago and still has some exposed mine entrances. It contains thousands of acres of heavy forests and swamps consisting of pine and hardwoods with ample food sources of vegetation and wildlife, including many deer. There are also several nearby creeks and ponds. This area also has a rich history of sightings, including the sightings of the same or other dirty-white individuals along with dark colored creatures. As mentioned in the report, her husband's sister also had an encounter with a white creature when she was 10 years old. See Report #27480.

Just as I was flipping the canoe up to put on my shoulders I heard this very loud ""WHOOOOP, WHOOOP, WHOOOP, WHOOOP"", then a pause then three more whoops. I 've been in the woods enough to know it was not an owl or like any sound I've EVER heard in the woods or on a river. Too loud, too powerful.

I didn't even tie it on properly until I got up to the highway. The weird part was I had been watching the Monster Quest series and the month before had come down the same river and thought ""This area looks just like that crap they show in the Pacific Northwest where those bogfoots are. Wonder if there were ever any bigfoots in Alabama?"" So I did an internet search and it surprised the crap out of me and found a whole freakin website about Alabama Bigfoots. Those sounds I heard sounded just like the whoops you have on this web site. Of course after watching those shows it could have been somebody doing that call blasting thing but I had emailed the Alabama Research people and they said they did not have anyone working that area at that time(AUG 2010).

He is interested in the bigfoot phenomenon and uses his time in the outdoors to also look for evidence. We talked about the other unusual things that happened to him while in the area. One night, while he was camping in a primitive location, he woke at 4 AM to footsteps outside his tent. He was camping alone, and was in an area not easily accessible. On another occasion in the area, he was fishing at dusk and noticed the area had become eerily quiet. He did a few ""whoop"" calls and began to hear something in the brush behind him. Unable to see it, he threw a tangerine at the sound. He went back to fishing only to notice something hit the water near him. He thought it may have been something falling off a tree, until a second rock was thrown. He noticed that it was angled and had a trajectory. He left the area as quickly as possible. Mr. Johnson had also experienced extremely foul smells while in the area, but is unsure of the source.

The shoulder width was estimated at 3 feet. It had dark brown hair, with an orange tint, covering its entire head and body from 2-4 inches long. The face was completely covered with short hair of the same color. The legs were slightly apart. The feet were out of sight because of the curvature of the downhill slope. The arms were hanging straight down with human like hands. The creature quickly turned to its left and bounded diagonally away down the steep hill with long, straight-legged hops similar to what a deer might do. The arms were swinging right foot and right hand forward, left foot and left hand forward. The stride was 6-7 feet from the measurements Mr. X took in the leaf litter. The sounds went out of sight, over a 4-foot fence, and on down the very steep hillside out of hearing range. This sketch below depicts approximately what the witness saw before the creature fled. With both sightings, the wife said the creature behaved as if it was more afraid of her than she was of it and that she believes it was the same creature. On 12/4/13, Mrs. X was checking the greens in the garden next to the house, which rests between the two previous sighting locations.

Between my visit and phone calls, I’m convinced they are truthful. The witnesses first became aware of the creature at 1am on a full moon night in October 2013. Mrs. X heard their two small dogs barking, so she went onto the back deck and watched the two dogs run toward a pack of barking dogs running up the road toward her house. She then started hearing the thump, thump, thump coming from a dark, upright, huge figure slowly running on 2 legs up the middle of the road with the pack of barking dogs keeping pace 10 yards back. When the creature got to a patch of dense woods, about 50 yards away from the witness, it stopped, squatted down until its hands touched the ground, sprung back up while spinning around to face the dogs, and let out a very loud, growling screeching scream with its arms out. Mrs. X gasped and said, “oh my gosh” aloud. The creature turned to face her, then turned to the opposite direction and walked straight into the dense undergrowth and woods. The pack of dogs followed, but her two dogs returned when they saw her on the deck. The witness also has a Great Dane and it leaned against the gate with its hair bristled the entire time not allowing Mrs. X to go after the two small dogs when she first stepped outside. The next notable occurrence was in their chicken coup. Two 2x4 cross members holding the chicken wires at the top, about 8 feet off the ground, were ripped down, and their two chickens were on the ground with their necks broken. Also, many of their caged quail located in the same barn have disappeared over time at night from an enclosure which requires hands to open. The cage is always shut the next morning. The second sighting occurred on November 2, 2013 around 4:45 PM, about one hour before sunset. Mrs. X was closing the back doors of their barn when she thought she saw movement in the woods downhill in her peripheral vision. As she was shutting the second half of the doors, she caught sight of movement again. She looked up straight at a creature, estimated between 7.5 and 8 feet tall, which froze staring back at her from 110 feet away. It was facing her. She estimated the weight at 450 lbs. The shoulder width was estimated at 3 feet. It had dark brown hair, with an orange tint, covering its entire head and body from 2-4 inches long. The face was completely covered with short hair of the same color. The legs were slightly apart. The feet were out of sight because of the curvature of the downhill slope. The arms were hanging straight down with human like hands. The creature quickly turned to its left and bounded diagonally away down the steep hill with long, straight-legged hops similar to what a deer might do. The arms were swinging right foot and right hand forward, left foot and left hand forward. The stride was 6-7 feet from the measurements Mr. X took in the leaf litter. The sounds went out of sight, over a 4-foot fence, and on down the very steep hillside out of hearing range. This sketch below depicts approximately what the witness saw before the creature fled. With both sightings, the wife said the creature behaved as if it was more afraid of her than she was of it and that she believes it was the same creature. On 12/4/13, Mrs. X was checking the greens in the garden next to the house, which rests between the two previous sighting locations. She found three fresh bare foot prints 9 inches long and 5 inches wide. There were 2 lefts and 1 right. Here is the best photo: Dermal ridges were present on one of the casts. A set of small deer tracks were also present. The track casting took place at night, just as rain moved in. A rock was thrown and landed less than ten feet from the couple and the print being cast at the time. There was also banging on the back side of the barn while casting (where the second sighting took place). Afterwards, it was noted that the newly installed, tight chicken coup wire had been stretched in a spherical shape about 18” off the ground. It was still stretched tight and flat before the casting started. One of their new chickens was rousting in the rafters instead of their normal rousting place which had never happened before. The impression in the wire was made by something at least as big as a basketball. I got down on all fours and pushed my head into the spherical impression. I found I was looking through an 18” opening in the barn wall straight at where the tracks were being cast. Screams and howls have been heard for several months. The witnesses have had responses to provocation sounds as well. The witnesses live in a rural area about two miles south of the Bankhead National Forrest. Travel to the National Forrest from their home can be made completely through the woods with only two road crossings. There is about three square miles of woods and rough terrain both behind and across the road in front of their home. These six square miles of woods are a mix of hardwood and evergreen private land with mostly no hunting. All signs of activity ended when deer season ended. Nearby Bankhead National Forest is heavily hunted. It is my belief Mrs. X saw a Sasquatch twice and they most likely had a juvenile leave tracks. I also believe they were observed and harassed by a Sasquatch while casting.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=43120

(The narrow patch of woods then stretched on northward.) Leaves were on the ground. That was the first thing that impinged on my consciousness -- the sound of something walking through leaves. It was a measured long tread, I could tell. I started really looking around trying to see what was making those sounds. (I was much braver back then.) Then over on the other side of the ravine close to the bottom but definitely walking uphill, I saw it. For all of about three seconds, seemed like longer at the time, and about 50-100 yards away. It was very large and I could see that it was hairy. I could see the ground between it's moving legs, and some vague image of arms, but not the head. Some forest branch obscured my view of the very top part of the body. I could tell it was walking upright uphill. It wasn't a bear; it was striding with a purpose up the hill on the other side. It was quickly out of sight. Now I know I wasn't thinking clearly, because I decided I had to try to get a better look at it. So I ran as quickly as I could around the rim of the ravine, since it's origins began in our front yard (not the best playground I can tell you). Anyway, it didn't take me long to reach the other side and move down into the woods slightly to look around and see if I could find it again. I did not see it again. I was there for only a minute or so when it suddenly occurred to me that I didn't hear anything anymore at all, no sound, no birds, no nothing, and fear like I'd never known before hit me and I went running practically screaming back to the house for mother. I told her what I'd seen and she, of course, did not believe me, though she told me to never tell anyone else the story. For a long time I didn't tell anyone, except family members, but they didn't believe. It didn't help that only one or two people since then truly believe that I saw a BigFoot. Since then I have lots of trouble going out alone in the woods.

We were staying at a motel in BullShoals. One morning we drove to a remote area of the river to fish via an unkown dirt road. We stopped to fish a bend of the river. On the opposite side of the river(west), was a tall stone bluff with a slight over crop from erosion. On the east side was flatter land with 12 to 20 foot thin scrub trees about 20 to 30 feet from the water, as the river was low. While my mother and aunt where fishing off the bank, I decided to try my luck further up river, about 300 yards away and just out of sight with my mother. While I was fishing along the bank I began to hear rustling sounds in the trees and shrubs behind me. I looked in the direction of the noise and could see the tops of the these thin trees moving as if something were walking through them and pushing them to the side, but due to the thickness of the vegetation I could not see what was actually moving the trees. I stood and observed this activity for 2 or 3 minutes. I began hearing grunting type sounds that were very deep and substantial sounding. These sounds were similar but different than grunt sounds a bull would make. The movement of the trees began to appear as if something were shaking the trees at this point instead of moving through them. It appeared that whatever was making the noises was only about 10 feet inside the brush yet I could not see what it was. Feeling nervous, I decided I should return to my mothers side and began walking back towards my mother. As I did, whatever was in the brush moved with me step for step. As I walked the movement in the trees seemed more forceful with the sounds of large branches breaking as it moved. When I got within sight of my mother (about 50 yards), all activity stopped. I informed my mother there was something in the brush following me, but she shrugged it off. Within a few minutes we decided to leave as we werent catching any fish.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"grunting , tree shaking",tree shaking,NA,grunting,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"Spoke to the witness on 1-28-2005. He had gone fishing on the White River with his mother and aunt in the morning (he estimates 10 AM as it was just starting to get really warm outside) in a remote area near Norfork . They weren’t having any luck and he wandered up the river around a bend and out of sight of his mother and aunt to see if he’d have better luck fishing. Soon afterwards he described hearing very deep grunts, snorts and heavy breathing sounds coming from some thick vegetation approximately 20 feet behind him. He said at the time he was 13 years old and the thought of a Bigfoot never crossed his mind. He thought it was probably a deer or a cow and didn’t feel overly concerned. He could see branches moving and shaking in the vegetation, but was never able to see what was there. He described the grunting sounds as “whoooooomp” and said they sounded very deep mixed with snort-type sounds and a heavy breathing as from a large animal. He listened and watched for a few minutes trying to see if he could make anything out in the vegetation and finally decided he should head back to where his mother and aunt were. As he was walking back whatever had been in the vegetation began following him at which point he started feeling nervous. He felt like he was being watched. He describes the area he was walking next to as very dense with very thick scrub brush with dense cane-like trees that were about 15 feet tall, 2 – 3 inches in diameter and very sparse with few branches. He said it sounded like it was very close and he should have been able to see it, but wasn’t able to. He could see the trees moving as whatever was paralleling him seemed to be pushing through the trees and said it looked like it was grabbing the trees and holding them aside as it pushed through. He continued to hear occasional “whooooomps” and grunts and stated it didn’t sound the way a hoofed animal would walk on four legs, but more like it had two legs and was loudly breaking and snapping branches as it walked. He stopped on two occasions trying to see what it was at which point whatever it was stopped as well. As he approached the area where his mother and aunt were and gained sight of them, the sounds stopped completely in an area where the thick scrub brush and trees came to an end near a clearing. He told his mother he was being followed by something and she seemed to shrug it off and they prepared to leave. He said he watched the area intently where the sounds had stopped at as they prepared to leave but never saw anything. He has been fishing in this area several times now that he’s an adult, but been unable to find the location where this occurred to him as a child.

As they were nearing highway 62 and slowing for the stop sign at the intersection, they were startled to see in the beams of the vehicle's headlights a tall dark figure walking upright down the embankment on the west (passenger's side) of the road. It then made one long jumping step to the road's center line where it briefly paused, turned to look closely at the vehicle and passengers. Both men stated the animal then dropped with its knuckles on the ground, and ""swung his body through its arms and leaped several feet high into a pine thicket alongside the road where it disappeared from view."" In speaking with the witnesses by phone they both agreed the animal was over seven feet tall, with a very muscular body and covered in dark brown, shaggy hair. They assumed that it was a male but could not be certain that it was. Both men believe the animal was not a mature adult. When the animal disappeared, the driver turned to his friend and asked if he had seen what had happened. He replied that he had. Both men decided that they would not discuss the incident with others for a while. The submitting witness described the landscape as ""wood government lake strip."" To expand on his description, the investigator has added the following comment. The area is within the Ozark Mountains, and is about ten miles due south of the Missouri state line. The sighting occurred near Norfork Lake which is a U.S. Corps of Engineers lake which covers about 22,00 acres. The event occurred near one of the corps' fenced service areas. During our discussion of the event the men mentioned there was a ""Catfish Restaurant"" not far from the sighting location. The animal had come from that direction when seen, and disappeared from view down a hollow that entered the lake and formed Panther Bay. There have been numerous reports from this and other Arkansas lakes of enigmatic primates routinely checking containers near fish cleaning stations. During the Investigator's several discussions with the primary submitter of this report, he mentioned an unusual audible event which he heard along the lake near his home three years ago. He said that event was partially the reason for him submitting this primary encounter which occurred thirteen years earlier. He said that he was fishing off the bank of the lake near his home late at night. It was calm and cold. Directly across the lake was a ridge that formed a peninsula. He suddenly heard a large pack of coyotes high on the ridge excitedly vocalizing and moving down toward the lake. When the canines were about halfway down the ridge, they became silent. Immediately, from a location on the ridge closer to the lake, he heard two or three loud and quick noises like a hollow tree being struck by a heavy object followed by loud whooping sounds. At once the coyotes began frantically vocalizing and moving back up the ridge. Within a few seconds, the tree beating and whooping sounds were repeated, although he could tell they came from much further up the ridge. The witness said the same sequence of sounds, continued for about two miles up the ridge at an incredible speed, with the knocking and whooping sounds getting closer to the coyotes constantly. Near the top of the ridge all the sounds stopped. The witness stated he recorded the sounds on a cell phone, and when he listened to it later he was able to hear other whooping sounds that he had been unable to hear as the event occurred. (He said that unfortunately the recording was accidentally erased from that phone.)

He retold his encounter to me honestly and matter of factly. Mr. G stated he and some friends were riding 4-wheelers in the Posey Mountain area and being somewhat of a daredevil, he was the first to go down a hill in this region. He said while waiting for his friends to come down the hill he rode around at the bottom to kill time. While looking up the other side of the hill he noted an animal standing bipedally appearing to reach up into the branches of a tree. Mr. G is an avid hunter and stated, in his opinion, this was no bear. His distance from the animal was approximately 150 feet. He stated it surprised him and he rode back to where his friends were urging them to go look. He stated by the time he got back to the area the sighting took place the creature turned and strode upright back over the crest of the hill and out of sight. He stated it was covered in hair from head to toe. He said he did not get a good look at the facial features, however, he felt they were hairy as well. He said the creature was thinner than would be expected for an upright bear with longer legs. and a long gait as it walked out of sight. He stated it walked smoothly more in keeping with a human gait than that of an animal. He said the animal's height he thought was around 6 feet, but could have been as much as 8 feet. He was unsure of this detail. His friends saw nothing as they were behind him. He said that he does not believe in UFO's or ghosts, or even bigfoot until this encounter.

The raccoon tracks proceeded about 20 yards away from the water, to an area of great disturbance in the packed sandy soil. Disturbance as in some type of scuffle. The raccoon tracks intersected with two sets of human like footprints which had come from a nearby wood line. From the disturbance site, the human type tracks returned to the wood line, but the raccoon tracks ceased to exist. We did not have a camera or tape measure, but one set of tracks were 16-17 inches long and about 5 to 6 inches across at the ball of the foot. The smaller set, which ran parallel to the larger, were about 11 inches in length and maybe 4 to 5 inches at the ball.

One night after a runout performance in Missouri several of us were driving back to the festival site. We were on hwy 62(?) between Beaver Lake and Eureka Springs. It was after midnight when our carlights illuminated someone or thing standing off of the right (south) side of the road. It raised its hands and covered its face I assume due to the carlights. We saw no clothes on it and it appeared to be covered in brownish hair. What we saw didn't really register at first. We all thought it was very strange that someone would be out there naked at that time of night. None of us thought it was a bear because we saw hands (also, I had seen bear in that part of Arkansas and this did not resemble a bear). We didn't stop or turn around because we were all a little freaked out. I later realised that this thing had been standing on a small slope. It must have been 7-8 feet tall. It wasn't thick or bulky but appeared thin in comparison to its height. Ever since the first incident I have read and seen everything I could get my hands on concerning bigfoot.

The witness was in the back seat on the passenger side looking out the window when he observed an animal rise from a squatting position to a standing position on two legs. This animal was described to be tall approximately 7-8 feet in height, and lean, not thin, but muscular. He could not give me any facial details because he stated The animal raised its ""hand"" palm outward to cover its eyes. He stated the hand was very large and that he remembers when the animal moved to cover its eyes, the hand was down below the knee area swinging upward to the face, covering it. He said he did not note whether there was a point on this animal's head because of the large hand obscuring the face. He could not say whether the hand had hair on the palm or whether it was dark skin, but was quite sure it was a hand and not a paw. This animal was brown in color with what appeared to be human like hair covering its body. When asked about the other occupants of the car he was sure they had all seen the animal because they originally thought it was a man on the side of the road miles from any town. They discussed how odd it was for someone to do that at that time of night all alone, however, in further discussion realized the ""man"" wasn't wearing any discernible clothes and was very large. He stated he would try to locate the other four witnesses and would foward that information if he was successful. They were aquaintances who were all in a play.

From those conversations, the following details can be added to his initial report: The witness was driving a minivan west at night at a speed near 70 mph on Highway 82. The motorist said that he was about three miles inside Chicot County, AR, after having crossed the Mississippi River bridge from Greenville, MS. His wife was sitting in the front passenger's seat and was looking at her cell phone in her lap. Their children were asleep in the rear seat. The driver stated that he suddenly saw in the beam of the van's headlights ""a tall, large, greyish-haired creature, standing on his legs, run across the highway"" about three hundred feet in front of his van. The figure was running from a sparsely wooded area on the right (north) side of the highway and crossed the highway quickly in three long steps. It disappeared in a sparsely wooded area south of the highway. He stated the figure was uniformly covered in greyish hair of unknown length. It appeared that its body was ""solid and heavy,"" and seemed to be between six and eight feet tall. He said the figure's height was a rough estimate because at all times the figure was ""hunched over"" with its head also leaning slightly down. The figure never turned it head to look toward the van. Based on statements from the witness and this writer's familiarity with this area, it is believed the motorist saw the figure cross Highway 72 at the Ditch Bayou bridge. Highway 82 closely follows along the south side of Lake Chicot for about ten miles. Ditch Bayou is connected to Lake Chicot, which is noted for its abundance of large catfish, crappie and bass. The figure seen was leaving the lake area.

That particular day we had to paint some boundry line around an area near Biern, AR, just southwest of Gurdon, AR. It was in the afternoon and I had already finished ""brushing"" out the line for the others to paint the dots on the tree. I knew of an old black man that lived in a little shack not far from there. He ALWAYS had an old loggers helmet on, carried an ole filled 22, and only wore blue overalls and a white shirt. After I had finished, I made my way back to the truck which was on a road that was near the railroad tracks. These tracks went through the middle of Biern. As you pull into Biern from hwy 67, you cross these tracks and then turn right for approx. 2 miles. The road then T's and can go to the right to cross the tracks again. In 1984, the road only went about another 1\4 mile before turning back to the right back to 67. Our truck was parked on that last turn that goes back to hwy 67. I had made my way onto the tracks to wait for the others. I wasn't quite a 1\4 mile from where the road crosses over the tracks. The signs that let you know of the tracks are maybe 8 ft. high. When I noticed something on the tracks at that cross-over, I noticed that it ""appeared"" to be another foot taller. That could have been an optical illusion at that distance. I noticed that I could not see the silver hard hat that the old man always wore, or the white shirt, or the gun. This thing, what ever it might have been stopped on the trakcs and turned. But when it turned, it had to turn the whole upper torso as though it had a stiff neck. It was mostly dark in color, it did have some lighter spots on it. It appeared to take a step towards me when another logging companies truck gun it's motor and startled the creature. It seemed to notice this, turn and take two steps to get into the woods. If you have ever been down the tracks of the railroad, you know that it would be impossible for a normal man to make that kind of distance in only two steps. You have to take into consideration that I was only 18 at the time and still had a pretty vivid imagination. Even with the evidence I had at that time, I questioned what I might have really seen. It wasn't until later that I found out that there have been many sightings of some creature in that part of the woods. A buddy of mine told me that his grandmother lived in that area and had trouble from a two legged creature getting into her garbage at night. He said that there was only one time that the creature came up on her back porch and look into her window. She said that it looked somewhat like a monkey. She never admitted that she was scared because it never threatened her in any way. This story sort of validated mine. This is not the only time that I have seen a creature out int woods.

In a final telephone interview the witness clarified a few items and added others as follows: The ""shack tube"" mentioned above should have been a ""shake tube"" which is a device used in turkey hunting to duplicate turkey calls. He stated in the time before the animal leaped from the tracks it was walking upright bipedally slightly stooped at the waist with arms swinging.

He said that he had been cutting a load of firewood and was coming down a dirt road that goes from the bottom of the canyon on the Snake River and goes up into the timber. He said that it was hunting season and from one place on this road he could look down the mountain and he thought he could see a bear by a salt box. These salt boxes are put out by ranchers to put blocks of salt out for cattle. He said his intention was to shoot this bear so he hurried down the road in his pickup. There are many switch backs coming down this road and so at times he couldn't see this thing. When he finally could see it again he was about 400 yards from it. He said that it stood up on its hind legs and quickly walked about 40 to 50 yards where it went down into a steep creek bottom.

My older brother and I were messing around in the creek below the ghost town and we looked up to see bigfoot running up the creek. We were a little scared at seeing what looked to be a very hairy human running up past us. It just not really looked like a human face - it was different. He kind of looked like a monkey with a human body. My brother and I ran up to where our family was having a BBQ and they ran down just to see him running into the trees.

It was sunset, I ran him up the fairly short distance to the highest switchback and turned off the ATV, walking a hundred yards or so to give him privacy. It started getting dark (it gets dark and cold that high up real fast) and I began meandering back to hopefully hurry him up. As I approached a cluster of trees right up against the switchback on the uphill side, there was the deepest growl I've ever heard - in a warning manner. At first I thought it was a cat, but it was much deeper in resonance. Thinking this would be a short trip, I left my rifle and shotgun at camp, and only had my 1911 sidearm on me, and I wasted no time in shucking it. I was fearful for Steve, as this thing was between me and Steve who was unaware of any threat, so I slid-walked toward Steve, both arms extended at ready-fire. I peered as closely as I could, but could see nothing due to the tree cluster and twilight. As I finally slid-walked past the cluster and was now between the previously unaware Steve, I chanced a quick look over my right shoulder to see if Steve had noted anything yet. He had, and had also shucked his pistol, with the phone in the other hand, clearly getting off. As my head was turning back toward the low growling in the tree cluster, halfway, I was stunned to see an absolutely massive, huge, very tall creature hurrying toward the tree cluster. It actually had to slide past me to get to the cluster, so it wasn't threatening me. It reached the cluster and I heard no further noise, steadily backing up. Had there been a cat in those trees, there surely would have been quite a ruckus, but things went silent. I recall very clearly being not stunned by its size, but how fast it was and how quickly it covered ground. I remember thinking, 'this thing could run down a deer.' From Steve's angle, he couldn't see it, but the thing had to run across some thirty yards of knee high (to me) growth, so I got a good look at this thing. I reached the ATV and said, ""we're leaving."" In retrospect, after replaying this a hundred times again and again, I feel that there was either a female or juvenile in the trees, and was surprised when I approached, and growled to warn me off. This is entirely speculative, but I feel confident that the huge adult was hustling over to the tree cluster to tell the other one to 'knock it off.' The .45ACP is a very effective anti-personnel round up close. However, when I saw the sheer mass, if this thing wanted me dead, as big and as fast as he was, he'd have had me. Steve found another location to make phone calls after that which was much closer to the camp. Two weeks later, he came fogging it back to camp running - as he heard loud thumping steps and turned to see one running away - up the mountain. We stayed another few weeks, but I didn't get a lot of sleep.",1,8.2,NA,Na,NA,NA,dark brown,NA,cream,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,muscular,NA,NA,NA,NA,fleeting,running,bipedal,growl,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,"I spoke with the witness by telephone for approximately 45 minutes. He was speaking from his home in the Southeast. He is a mature, lucid, and articulate man. His demeanor was calm, yet obviously disturbed by his encounter. He explained that this was the first time he had ever seen anything like this and that he was still in disbelief. While the incident had occurred at least a year prior, the witness described the vivid imagery that still plagued his memory. Having served as a career Special Forces soldier in the Viet Nam conflict with extensive decorations, the witness related that he was an avid tracker, hunter, and all-around outdoorsman. He said his military occupation was “manhunter,” but he had never seen such a creature. While the vocalizations at first gave him the impression he was dealing with a large cat, he described that once he saw the subject, it was at least 2.5 meters tall, having shoulders “twice as wide as any man,” and dark, muddy brown, almost black, longer hair with a “cream-colored” face. His military technical jargon and vernacular were present during our conversation. In retelling the encounter, he detailed how the creature at first “growled” which appeared to be from a distance in the tree cluster, but the vibratory sensation and sonic impact felt as if the animal were standing next to him. In the ensuing moments, he saw the creature come between him and his friend and he said panic began to set in, mainly because he felt his sidearm would have been useless had the creature decided to attack himself or his friend. The witness repeatedly emphasized the girth of the animal’s legs, and the rapidity of movement, as apparently the creature was also in some sort of panic mode. The witness mentioned that the lodging he had taken during his stay in the area was staffed by a couple who were very familiar with the presence of large upright bipedal animals in the location of his encounter. I subsequently visited and interviewed the couple. They explained that the witness stayed in their inn along with Steve, as well as several other miners for the duration of their mineral exploration. The couple told me of two other encounters as recently as July 2012 by miners who stayed in their inn. Then they took me to the location of the witnesses encounter, high in the surrounding hills. While we accessed the location of the encounter via ATV late in the afternoon, one of the innkeepers spotted a ""dark figure"" on the ridge across from the switchback, in a clearing on a rocky outcrop. We attempted to spot the figure again via binoculars and 9x scope without success. This location is steep, not accessible unless by the most robust of vehicles, and known for mysterious vocalizations and sightings. All details from the innkeepers correlated with the witnesses description of the events. Since the town has an extensive mining history, there is also associated lore describing ""monsters"" in the hills.",NA,NA,https://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_report.asp?id=36076

My husband was leading me along the trail and he did not hear this sound. I stopped him and described the sound to him as a sort of ""wild boar"" type sound. It was VERY hard to describe. The sound was low, deep, like a vibrating growl or snort. We looked around and listened. When we didn't hear anything for quite a few minutes, we began walking again. Not more than 3 or 4 steps down the trail we hear a rustle noise and I quickly turned to see a rock or something rather large, dark and round fall to the ground with a large THUMP! The item had landed just where I was standing only a moment before. My husband heard this large item hit the ground and we stood stunned for a moment trying to figure out where it came from. I looked around the area and found a rock about the size of a baseball sitting where the item had hit the ground. My husband and I could NOT figure out where it had come from. Was a rock in the tree and it just now fell? Did something throw that rock at us? We were a bit jumpy but kept on down the trail. About 1/4 mile along the trail we hear a loud ""whomp, whomp"" like wood against wood sound ahead of us up on the hill. I asked my husband what that was and he decided it was probably just some people doing work on the trail. I didn't believe that's what it was. It sounded too heavy to be man made. Maybe machinery, but there was no motor sound and it was a Sunday evening. I doubt workers were on duty at this time and on this day. Just then we heard the sound move and we turned to hear the same wood on wood ""whomp"" noise behind us on the trail and still above us on the hill. My husband remarked, ""If that was bigfoot I don't know how he moved that quickly!"" I told him that we could rule out trail workers and that it was quite possible that it was TWO bigfoot communicating with each other. We joked about it, but we were both very shaken. We just could not come up with a more reasonable explanation for this sound. My husband describes this sound as a person hitting a tree quite hard with a large log. After yet another few minutes of looking around and hoping to see something, we walked along the trail without answers. After this we heard nothing more and came across several hikers on the last mile of the trail. Several hikers had dogs and we didn't hear any dogs going wild barking at anything unusual. My husband and I were going to stop some hikers to ask if they had heard anything, but we didn't want to look crazy or scare them away from the trail. Other than the rock being thrown at us we didn't feel as though we were in any kind of danger. When I got home I called my father who is quite familiar with forest animals and noises. He couldn't explain where the rock would have come from, but he believes that the wood on wood sound could possibly be deer or elk. I doubt that it was deer or elk just because the trail was so populated. They would have been spooked by the hikers and the dogs... besides, the ""whomp"" sound was SO heavy and SO loud that I can't imagine a deer making such a large sound. We didn't smell anything, we didn't see footprints...but I can't think of anything else that would explain these noises and the rock being thrown at us.

About half way through our hike, we heard a UAS (Unidentified Animal Sound). The best way I can describe it is to say that it was a short, deep, guttural whooping sound. Whatever it was, was clearly rather too close for our liking. We weren't really frightened, but we were unnerved enough to take safety precautions. I stopped taking pictures, and Travis & I insisted that the kids walk between us in a tight group for the remainder of the hike. The sound came and went, and at one point it became clear that there were at least two of whatever-they-were, because we realized that not all of the sounds were coming from the same direction. They were alternating, as if they were communicating.

There was a trail that was used by kids in the area to get down into the woods and a little way off the trail, my brother and I had hauled a little wood and built a little platform about six feet up in the crook of a tree. That day, around noon, we were in that platform, shooting our BB gun at a tall stump that was just a little ways down hill from where we were. My brother turned around as I was preparing to fire and just as I was ready to shoot the BB gun, something with a human-like head passed right in front of the tall stump. The trees and brush obscured everything but the head, but I got a good look at it. It had brown fur over almost all of the head, but not dark brown, just a little darker than cinnamon color, a kind of flat nose and the hair/fur was not too long. It walked by and disappeared into the brush almost without making a sound (there was a very heavy bed of needles from the Douglas Fir all over), it happened so suddenly and so fast that I didn't have a chance to get scared. I called my brother's name and he turned in time to see some of the branches still swaying. We stood there and talked about it for a few minutes and then carefully went down to where it passed in front of me and figured that it had to have been about 7 1/2 feet tall. After this, I went to my former eighth grade science teacher who happened to live in the neighborhood (this was a town of about 1,200 at the time) and told him about it. He was very skeptical and gave me numerous things that he thought I'd seen. He obviously didn't believe I had seen a Sasquatch/Bigfoot. Later that same day, around dusk, my brother and I were sitting on the trail, not too far from the ""tree fort"" that I had seen it from earlier in the day, talking about it. Suddenly, I'm not sure what made him do it, but he looked over at the platform that we had built (about 20 to 30 yards away) and his face turned white as a ghost. I looked over there and saw a sillouette of a""man"" looking at us (head and shoulders) from behind our tree fort. Since it was dusk, we weren't able to make out any features, just the outline. Also, we both jumped up and ran the rest of the way home, scared half out of our wits. The second sighting we had that day, the creature didn't seem anything but curious about us, but it still scared us. Also, two years later, I was down in the woods at almost midnight (I'd left something down there the previous day) and heard footsteps coming towards me and a huffing noise, almost like a horse blowing. I dropped my flashlight and ran the 3/4 mile home in record time.
